    "Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres. However, the standard SQL commands such as \"Select\", \"Insert\", \"Update\", \"Delete\", \"Create\", and \"Drop\" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database. This tutorial will provide you with the instruction on the basics of each of these commands as well as allow you to put them to practice using the SQL Interpreter.\n",

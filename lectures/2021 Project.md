### Project Structure and Assignments

Project will focus on the Processing Phase, i.e., ingestion, cleansing, and then query-based analyses 

During the course, you'll be assigned simple tasks in Airflow, which will be the base for your project!

You can complete the project points step by step and ASK FOR FEEDBACKS early!

### Project Structure Details


Every project must feature:

1. An initial pipeline where data are loaded from file (provided) and cleaned
2. A second pipeline where  data are loaded into an ingestion system and then cleaned and processed
3.  A third pipeline where a relational view is built on the data to perform some analysis
4.   A fourth pipeline where data are enriched (use your creativity) 
5.   A fifth pipeline where a graph view is built on the data to facilitate some analysis

Natural language analyses will be provided to be implemented at point 3 and 5, a  base example using the images (which are not stored) will be included in 4.

### Project Requirements and Grades

- 1-3: Up to 71 Points
- 4: Up to 61 Points
- Completing the base examples at 3,4,5 up to 91
- Re-implementing the pipeline as a streaming pipeline: up to 100
- Presenting original work: new analysis, innovative solution up to 100

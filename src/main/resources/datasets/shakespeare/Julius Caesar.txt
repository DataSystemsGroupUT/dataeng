    32  ******This file should be named 2ws2410.txt or 2ws2410.zip******
    33  
    34  Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 2ws2411.txt
    35  VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 2ws2410a.txt
    36  
    37  
    38  This etext was prepared by the PG Shakespeare Team,
    39  a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers.
    40  
    41  
    42  Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
    43  all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
    44  copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT! keep
    45  these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
    46  
    47  
    48  We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
    49  of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
    50  
    51  Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
    52  midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
    53  The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
    54  Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
    55  preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
    56  and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
    57  up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
    58  in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
    59  a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
    60  look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
    61  new copy has at least one byte more or less.

    64  Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
    65  
    66  We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
    67  time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
    68  to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
    69  searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
    70  projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
    71  per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
    72  million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
    73  files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
    74  If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
    75  total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
    76  
    77  The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
    78  Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
    79  This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
    80  which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
    81  
    82  At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
    83  of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
    84  manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
    85  from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
    86  assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
    87  more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
    88  don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
    89

   148  Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
   149  They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
   150  your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
   151  someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
   152  fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
   153  disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
   154  you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
   155  
   156  *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
   157  By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
   158  etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
   159  this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
   160  a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
   161  sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
   162  you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
   163  medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
   164  
   165  ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
   166  This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
   167  tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
   168  Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
   169  Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
   170  things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
   171  on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
   172  distribute it in the United States without permission and
   173  without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
   174  below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
   175  under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
   176  
   177  To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
   178  efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
   179  works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
   180  medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
   181  things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
   182  corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
   183  intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
   184  disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
   185  codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
   186  
   187  LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
   188  But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
   189  [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
   190  etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
   191  liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
   192  legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
   193  UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
   194  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   195  OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
   196  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   197  
   198  If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
   199  receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
   200  you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
   201  time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
   202  on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
   203  such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
   204  copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
   205  choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
   206  receive it electronically.
   207  
   208  THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
   209  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
   210  TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
   211  LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   212  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   213  
   214  Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
   215  the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
   216  above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
   217  may have other legal rights.
   218  
   219  INDEMNITY
   220  You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
   221  officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
   222  and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
   223  indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
   224  [1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
   225  or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.
   226

   242       [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
   243            does *not* contain characters other than those

   245            (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
   246            be used to convey punctuation intended by the
   247            author, and additional characters may be used to
   248            indicate hypertext links; OR
   249  
   250       [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
   251            no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent

   253            the case, for instance, with most word processors);
   254            OR
   255  
   256       [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
   257            no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
   258            etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
   259            or other equivalent proprietary form).
   260  
   261  [2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
   262       "Small Print!" statement.
   263  
   264  [3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
   265       net profits you derive calculated using the method you
   266       already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
   267       don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
   268       payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon

   335  
   336  
   337  ACT I.
   338  
   339  SCENE I. Rome. A street.
   340  
   341  [Enter Flavius, Marullus, and a Throng of Citizens.]
   342  
   343  FLAVIUS.
   344  Hence! home, you idle creatures, get you home!
   345  Is this a holiday? What! know you not,
   346  Being mechanical, you ought not walk
   347  Upon a laboring day without the sign
   348  Of your profession?--Speak, what trade art thou?
   349  
   350  FIRST CITIZEN.
   351  Why, sir, a carpenter.
   352  
   353  MARULLUS.
   354  Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
   355  What dost thou with thy best apparel on?--
   356  You, sir; what trade are you?
   357  
   358  SECOND CITIZEN.
   359  Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you
   360  would say, a cobbler.
   361  
   362  MARULLUS.
   363  But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
   364  
   365  SECOND CITIZEN.
   366  A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
   367  conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
   368  
   369  MARULLUS.
   370  What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?
   371  
   372  SECOND CITIZEN.
   373  Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet,
   374  if you be out, sir, I can mend you.  
   375  
   376  MARULLUS.
   377  What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!
   378  
   379  SECOND CITIZEN.
   380  Why, sir, cobble you.
   381  
   382  FLAVIUS.
   383  Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
   384  
   385  SECOND CITIZEN.
   386  Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I meddle with
   387  no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with awl.
   388  I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in
   389  great danger, I re-cover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
   390  neat's-leather have gone upon my handiwork.
   391  
   392  FLAVIUS.
   393  But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
   394  Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
   395  
   396  SECOND CITIZEN.
   397  Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself into more
   398  work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar and to
   399  rejoice in his triumph.
   400  
   401  MARULLUS.
   402  Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
   403  What tributaries follow him to Rome,
   404  To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
   405  You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
   406  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
   407  Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
   408  Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,  
   409  To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
   410  Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
   411  The livelong day with patient expectation
   412  To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
   413  And when you saw his chariot but appear,
   414  Have you not made an universal shout
   415  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
   416  To hear the replication of your sounds
   417  Made in her concave shores?
   418  And do you now put on your best attire?
   419  And do you now cull out a holiday?
   420  And do you now strew flowers in his way
   421  That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?
   422  Be gone!
   423  Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
   424  Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
   425  That needs must light on this ingratitude.
   426  
   427  FLAVIUS.
   428  Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
   429  Assemble all the poor men of your sort,
   430  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears  
   431  Into the channel, till the lowest stream
   432  Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
   433  
   434  [Exeunt CITIZENS.]
   435  
   436  See whether their basest metal be not moved;
   437  They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
   438  Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
   439  This way will I. Disrobe the images,
   440  If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
   441  
   442  MARULLUS.
   443  May we do so?
   444  You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
   445  
   446  FLAVIUS.
   447  It is no matter; let no images
   448  Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about
   449  And drive away the vulgar from the streets;
   450  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
   451  These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
   452  Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
   453  Who else would soar above the view of men,
   454  And keep us all in servile fearfulness.   
   455  
   456  [Exeunt.]

   458  
   459  
   460  SCENE II. The same. A public place.
   461  
   462  [Enter, in procession, with music, Caesar; Antony, for the
   463  course; Calpurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and
   464  Casca; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer.]
   465  
   466  CAESAR.
   467  Calpurnia,--
   468  
   469  CASCA.
   470  Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
   471  
   472  [Music ceases.]
   473  
   474  CAESAR.
   475  Calpurnia,--
   476  
   477  CALPURNIA. 
   478  Here, my lord.
   479  
   480  CAESAR.
   481  Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
   482  When he doth run his course.--Antonius,--
   483  
   484  ANTONY.
   485  Caesar, my lord?
   486  
   487  CAESAR.
   488  Forget not in your speed, Antonius,
   489  To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
   490  The barren, touched in this holy chase,
   491  Shake off their sterile curse.
   492  
   493  ANTONY.
   494  I shall remember.
   495  When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd.
   496  
   497  CAESAR.
   498  Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
   499  
   500  [Music.]
   501  
   502  SOOTHSAYER.
   503  Caesar!
   504  
   505  CAESAR.
   506  Ha! Who calls?
   507  
   508  CASCA.
   509  Bid every noise be still.--Peace yet again!
   510  
   511  [Music ceases.]
   512  
   513  CAESAR.
   514  Who is it in the press that calls on me?
   515  I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
   516  Cry "Caesar"! Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.
   517  
   518  SOOTHSAYER.
   519  Beware the Ides of March.
   520  
   521  CAESAR.
   522  What man is that?
   523  
   524  BRUTUS.
   525  A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March.
   526  
   527  CAESAR.
   528  Set him before me; let me see his face.
   529  
   530  CASSIUS.
   531  Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
   532  
   533  CAESAR.
   534  What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.
   535  
   536  SOOTHSAYER.
   537  Beware the Ides of March.
   538  
   539  CAESAR.
   540  He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.
   541  
   542  [Sennet. Exeunt all but BRUTUS and CASSIUS.]
   543  
   544  CASSIUS.
   545  Will you go see the order of the course?
   546  
   547  BRUTUS.
   548  Not I.
   549  
   550  CASSIUS.
   551  I pray you, do.
   552  
   553  BRUTUS.
   554  I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
   555  Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
   556  Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
   557  I'll leave you.
   558  
   559  CASSIUS.
   560  Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
   561  I have not from your eyes that gentleness
   562  And show of love as I was wont to have:
   563  You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
   564  Over your friend that loves you.
   565  
   566  BRUTUS.
   567  Cassius,
   568  Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
   569  I turn the trouble of my countenance
   570  Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
   571  Of late with passions of some difference,
   572  Conceptions only proper to myself,
   573  Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
   574  But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
   575  Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
   576  Nor construe any further my neglect,
   577  Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
   578  Forgets the shows of love to other men.
   579  
   580  CASSIUS.
   581  Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
   582  By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
   583  Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
   584  Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
   585  
   586  BRUTUS.
   587  No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
   588  But by reflection, by some other thing.
   589  
   590  CASSIUS.
   591  'Tis just:
   592  And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
   593  That you have no such mirrors as will turn
   594  Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
   595  That you might see your shadow. I have heard
   596  Where many of the best respect in Rome,--
   597  Except immortal Caesar!-- speaking of Brutus,
   598  And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
   599  Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
   600  
   601  BRUTUS.
   602  Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
   603  That you would have me seek into myself
   604  For that which is not in me?
   605  
   606  CASSIUS.
   607  Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear;
   608  And since you know you cannot see yourself
   609  So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
   610  Will modestly discover to yourself
   611  That of yourself which you yet know not of.
   612  And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;
   613  Were I a common laugher, or did use
   614  To stale with ordinary oaths my love
   615  To every new protester; if you know
   616  That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard
   617  And after scandal them; or if you know
   618  That I profess myself, in banqueting,
   619  To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
   620  
   621  [Flourish and shout.]
   622  
   623  BRUTUS.
   624  What means this shouting? I do fear the people
   625  Choose Caesar for their king.
   626  
   627  CASSIUS.
   628  Ay, do you fear it?
   629  Then must I think you would not have it so.
   630  
   631  BRUTUS.
   632  I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well,
   633  But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
   634  What is it that you would impart to me?
   635  If it be aught toward the general good,
   636  Set honor in one eye and death i' the other
   637  And I will look on both indifferently;
   638  For let the gods so speed me as I love
   639  The name of honor more than I fear death.
   640  
   641  CASSIUS.
   642  I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
   643  As well as I do know your outward favor.
   644  Well, honor is the subject of my story.
   645  I cannot tell what you and other men
   646  Think of this life; but, for my single self,
   647  I had as lief not be as live to be
   648  In awe of such a thing as I myself.
   649  I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
   650  We both have fed as well; and we can both
   651  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
   652  For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
   653  The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
   654  Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius, now
   655  Leap in with me into this angry flood
   656  And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,
   657  Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,
   658  And bade him follow: so indeed he did.
   659  The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
   660  With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
   661  And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
   662  But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
   663  Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!
   664  I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
   665  Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
   666  The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
   667  Did I the tired Caesar: and this man
   668  Is now become a god; and Cassius is
   669  A wretched creature, and must bend his body,
   670  If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
   671  He had a fever when he was in Spain;
   672  And when the fit was on him I did mark
   673  How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake:
   674  His coward lips did from their color fly;
   675  And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
   676  Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan:
   677  Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
   678  Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,
   679  Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"
   680  As a sick girl.--Ye gods, it doth amaze me,
   681  A man of such a feeble temper should
   682  So get the start of the majestic world,
   683  And bear the palm alone. 
   684  
   685  [Shout. Flourish.]
   686  
   687  BRUTUS.
   688  Another general shout!
   689  I do believe that these applauses are
   690  For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.
   691  
   692  CASSIUS.
   693  Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
   694  Like a Colossus; and we petty men
   695  Walk under his huge legs and peep about
   696  To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
   697  Men at some time are masters of their fates:
   698  The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
   699  But in ourselves,that we are underlings.
   700  "Brutus" and "Caesar": what should be in that "Caesar"?
   701  Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
   702  Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
   703  Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
   704  Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with them,
   705  "Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar."
   706  Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
   707  Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
   708  That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
   709  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
   710  When went there by an age since the great flood,
   711  But it was famed with more than with one man?
   712  When could they say, till now, that talk'd of Rome,
   713  That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
   714  Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,
   715  When there is in it but one only man.
   716  O, you and I have heard our fathers say
   717  There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
   718  Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,
   719  As easily as a king!
   720  
   721  BRUTUS.
   722  That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
   723  What you would work me to, I have some aim:
   724  How I have thought of this, and of these times,
   725  I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
   726  I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
   727  Be any further moved. What you have said,
   728  I will consider; what you have to say,
   729  I will with patience hear; and find a time
   730  Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
   731  Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
   732  Brutus had rather be a villager
   733  Than to repute himself a son of Rome
   734  Under these hard conditions as this time
   735  Is like to lay upon us.
   736  
   737  CASSIUS.
   738  I am glad that my weak words
   739  Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
   740  
   741  BRUTUS.
   742  The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
   743  
   744  CASSIUS.
   745  As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
   746  And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
   747  What hath proceeded worthy note today.
   748  
   749  [Re-enter Caesar and his Train.]
   750  
   751  BRUTUS.
   752  I will do so.--But, look you, Cassius,
   753  The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
   754  And all the rest look like a chidden train:
   755  Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
   756  Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
   757  As we have seen him in the Capitol,
   758  Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
   759  
   760  CASSIUS.
   761  Casca will tell us what the matter is.
   762  
   763  CAESAR.
   764  Antonius,--
   765  
   766  ANTONY.
   767  Caesar?
   768  
   769  CAESAR.
   770  Let me have men about me that are fat;
   771  Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
   772  Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
   773  He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
   774  
   775  ANTONY.
   776  Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
   777  He is a noble Roman and well given.
   778  
   779  CAESAR.
   780  Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
   781  Yet, if my name were liable to fear,
   782  I do not know the man I should avoid
   783  So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
   784  He is a great observer, and he looks
   785  Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
   786  As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music:
   787  Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort
   788  As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
   789  That could be moved to smile at any thing.
   790  Such men as he be never at heart's ease
   791  Whiles they behold a greater than themselves;
   792  And therefore are they very dangerous.
   793  I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
   794  Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.
   795  Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
   796  And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
   797  
   798  [Exeunt Caesar and his Train. Casca stays.]
   799  
   800  CASCA.
   801  You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
   802  
   803  BRUTUS.
   804  Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today,
   805  That Caesar looks so sad.
   806  
   807  CASCA.
   808  Why, you were with him, were you not?
   809  
   810  BRUTUS.
   811  I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
   812  
   813  CASCA.
   814  Why, there was a crown offer'd him; and being offer'd him,
   815  he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the
   816  people fell a-shouting.
   817  
   818  BRUTUS.
   819  What was the second noise for?
   820  
   821  CASCA.
   822  Why, for that too.
   823  
   824  CASSIUS.
   825  They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
   826  
   827  CASCA.
   828  Why, for that too.
   829  
   830  BRUTUS.
   831  Was the crown offer'd him thrice?
   832  
   833  CASCA.
   834  Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
   835  than other; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors
   836  shouted.
   837  
   838  CASSIUS.
   839  Who offer'd him the crown?
   840  
   841  CASCA.
   842  Why, Antony.
   843  
   844  BRUTUS.
   845  Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
   846  
   847  CASCA.
   848  I can as well be hang'd, as tell the manner of it: it was
   849  mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a
   850  crown;--yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these
   851  coronets;--and, as I told you, he put it by once: but, for all
   852  that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
   853  offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to my
   854  thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then
   855  he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and
   856  still, as he refused it, the rabblement shouted, and clapp'd
   857  their chopt hands, and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and
   858  uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused
   859  the crown, that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and
   860  fell down at it: and for mine own part, I durst not laugh for
   861  fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
   862  
   863  CASSIUS.
   864  But, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?
   865  
   866  CASCA.
   867  He fell down in the market-place, and foam'd at mouth, and was
   868  speechless.
   869  
   870  BRUTUS.
   871  'Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.
   872  
   873  CASSIUS.
   874  No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I,
   875  And honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness.
   876  
   877  CASCA.
   878  I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell
   879  down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him,
   880  according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do
   881  the players in the theatre, I am no true man.
   882  
   883  BRUTUS.
   884  What said he when he came unto himself?
   885  
   886  CASCA.
   887  Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
   888  herd was glad he refused the crown, he pluck'd me ope his
   889  doublet, and offered them his throat to cut: an I had been a
   890  man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
   891  I would I might go to hell among the rogues:--and so he fell.
   892  When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said
   893  any thing amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his
   894  infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas,
   895  good soul!" and forgave him with all their hearts. But there's
   896  no heed to be taken of them: if Caesar had stabb'd their
   897  mothers, they would have done no less.
   898  
   899  BRUTUS.
   900  And, after that he came, thus sad away?
   901  
   902  CASCA.
   903  Ay.
   904  
   905  CASSIUS.
   906  Did Cicero say any thing?
   907  
   908  CASCA.
   909  Ay, he spoke Greek.
   910  
   911  CASSIUS.
   912  To what effect?
   913  
   914  CASCA.
   915  Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
   916  again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and
   917  shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I
   918  could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling
   919  scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well.
   920  There was more foolery yet, if could remember it.
   921  
   922  CASSIUS.
   923  Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
   924  
   925  CASCA.
   926  No, I am promised forth.
   927  
   928  CASSIUS.
   929  Will you dine with me tomorrow?
   930  
   931  CASCA.
   932  Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
   933  the eating.
   934  
   935  CASSIUS.
   936  Good; I will expect you.
   937  
   938  CASCA.
   939  Do so; farewell both.
   940  
   941  [Exit CASCA.]
   942  
   943  BRUTUS.
   944  What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
   945  He was quick mettle when he went to school.
   946  
   947  CASSIUS.
   948  So is he now in execution
   949  Of any bold or noble enterprise,
   950  However he puts on this tardy form.
   951  This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
   952  Which gives men stomach to digest his words
   953  With better appetite.
   954  
   955  BRUTUS.
   956  And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
   957  Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
   958  I will come home to you; or, if you will,
   959  Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
   960  
   961  CASSIUS.
   962  I will do so: till then, think of the world.--
   963  
   964  [Exit Brutus.]
   965  
   966  Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
   967  Thy honorable metal may be wrought,
   968  From that it is disposed: therefore 'tis meet
   969  That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
   970  For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
   971  Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus;
   972  If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
   973  He should not humor me. I will this night,
   974  In several hands, in at his windows throw,
   975  As if they came from several citizens,
   976  Writings all tending to the great opinion
   977  That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
   978  Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
   979  And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
   980  For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
   981  
   982  [Exit.]
   983  
   984  
   985  
   986  SCENE III. The same. A street.
   987  
   988  [Thunder and lightning. Enter, from opposite sides, CASCA, with
   989  his sword drawn, and CICERO.]
   990  
   991  CICERO.
   992  Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
   993  Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?
   994  
   995  CASCA.
   996  Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
   997  Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
   998  I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
   999  Have rived the knotty oaks; and I have seen
  1000  Th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
  1001  To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
  1002  But never till tonight, never till now,
  1003  Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
  1004  Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
  1005  Or else the world too saucy with the gods,
  1006  Incenses them to send destruction.
  1007  
  1008  CICERO.
  1009  Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  1010  
  1011  CASCA.
  1012  A common slave--you'd know him well by sight--
  1013  Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
  1014  Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand
  1015  Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.
  1016  Besides,--I ha' not since put up my sword,--
  1017  Against the Capitol I met a lion,
  1018  Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
  1019  Without annoying me: and there were drawn
  1020  Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
  1021  Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
  1022  Men, all in fire, walk up and down the streets.
  1023  And yesterday the bird of night did sit
  1024  Even at noonday upon the marketplace,
  1025  Howling and shrieking. When these prodigies
  1026  Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
  1027  "These are their reasons; they are natural";
  1028  For I believe they are portentous things
  1029  Unto the climate that they point upon.
  1030  
  1031  CICERO.
  1032  Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  1033  But men may construe things after their fashion,
  1034  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  1035  Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
  1036  
  1037  CASCA.
  1038  He doth, for he did bid Antonius
  1039  Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
  1040  
  1041  CICERO.
  1042  Good then, Casca: this disturbed sky
  1043  Is not to walk in.
  1044  
  1045  CASCA.
  1046  Farewell, Cicero.
  1047  
  1048  [Exit Cicero.]
  1049  
  1050  [Enter Cassius.]
  1051  
  1052  CASSIUS.
  1053  Who's there?
  1054  
  1055  CASCA.
  1056  A Roman.
  1057  
  1058  CASSIUS.
  1059  Casca, by your voice.
  1060  
  1061  CASCA.
  1062  Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  1063  
  1064  CASSIUS.
  1065  A very pleasing night to honest men.
  1066  
  1067  CASCA.
  1068  Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  1069  
  1070  CASSIUS.
  1071  Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  1072  For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
  1073  Submitting me unto the perilous night;
  1074  And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
  1075  Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
  1076  And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
  1077  The breast of heaven, I did present myself
  1078  Even in the aim and very flash of it.
  1079  
  1080  CASCA.
  1081  But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens?
  1082  It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
  1083  When the most mighty gods by tokens send
  1084  Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
  1085  
  1086  CASSIUS.
  1087  You are dull, Casca;and those sparks of life
  1088  That should be in a Roman you do want,
  1089  Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze,
  1090  And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
  1091  To see the strange impatience of the Heavens:
  1092  But if you would consider the true cause
  1093  Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
  1094  Why birds and beasts,from quality and kind;
  1095  Why old men, fools, and children calculate;--
  1096  Why all these things change from their ordinance,
  1097  Their natures, and preformed faculties
  1098  To monstrous quality;--why, you shall find
  1099  That Heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
  1100  To make them instruments of fear and warning
  1101  Unto some monstrous state. Now could I, Casca, 
  1102  Name to thee a man most like this dreadful night;
  1103  That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars,
  1104  As doth the lion in the Capitol;
  1105  A man no mightier than thyself or me
  1106  In personal action; yet prodigious grown,
  1107  And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
  1108  
  1109  CASCA.
  1110  'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
  1111  
  1112  CASSIUS.
  1113  Let it be who it is: for Romans now
  1114  Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
  1115  But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
  1116  And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
  1117  Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
  1118  
  1119  CASCA.
  1120  Indeed they say the senators to-morrow
  1121  Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
  1122  And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
  1123  In every place save here in Italy.
  1124  
  1125  CASSIUS.
  1126  I know where I will wear this dagger then;
  1127  Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
  1128  Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
  1129  Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
  1130  Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
  1131  Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron
  1132  Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
  1133  But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
  1134  Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
  1135  If I know this, know all the world besides,
  1136  That part of tyranny that I do bear
  1137  I can shake off at pleasure.
  1138  
  1139  [Thunders still.]
  1140  
  1141  CASCA.
  1142  So can I:
  1143  So every bondman in his own hand bears
  1144  The power to cancel his captivity.
  1145  
  1146  CASSIUS.
  1147  And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  1148  Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
  1149  But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
  1150  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
  1151  Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
  1152  Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
  1153  What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves
  1154  For the base matter to illuminate
  1155  So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
  1156  Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
  1157  Before a willing bondman: then I know
  1158  My answer must be made; but I am arm'd,
  1159  And dangers are to me indifferent.
  1160  
  1161  CASCA.
  1162  You speak to Casca; and to such a man
  1163  That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
  1164  Be factious for redress of all these griefs;
  1165  And I will set this foot of mine as far
  1166  As who goes farthest.
  1167  
  1168  CASSIUS.
  1169  There's a bargain made.
  1170  Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
  1171  Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
  1172  To undergo with me an enterprise
  1173  Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
  1174  And I do know by this, they stay for me
  1175  In Pompey's Porch: for now, this fearful night,
  1176  There is no stir or walking in the streets;
  1177  And the complexion of the element
  1178  Is favor'd like the work we have in hand,
  1179  Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
  1180  
  1181  CASCA.
  1182  Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  1183  
  1184  CASSIUS.
  1185  'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
  1186  He is a friend.--
  1187  
  1188  [Enter Cinna.]
  1189  
  1190  Cinna, where haste you so?
  1191  
  1192  CINNA.
  1193  To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  1194  
  1195  CASSIUS.
  1196  No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  1197  To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
  1198  
  1199  CINNA.
  1200  I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  1201  There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
  1202  
  1203  CASSIUS.
  1204  Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
  1205  
  1206  CINNA.
  1207  Yes,
  1208  You are. O Cassius, if you could but win
  1209  The noble Brutus to our party,--
  1210  
  1211  CASSIUS.
  1212  Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  1213  And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
  1214  Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
  1215  In at his window; set this up with wax
  1216  Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
  1217  Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.
  1218  Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
  1219  
  1220  CINNA.
  1221  All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  1222  To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie
  1223  And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
  1224  
  1225  CASSIUS.
  1226  That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.--
  1227  
  1228  [Exit Cinna.]
  1229  
  1230  Come, Casca, you and I will yet, ere day,
  1231  See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
  1232  Is ours already; and the man entire,
  1233  Upon the next encounter, yields him ours.
  1234  
  1235  CASCA.
  1236  O, he sits high in all the people's hearts!
  1237  And that which would appear offense in us,
  1238  His countenance, like richest alchemy,
  1239  Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
  1240  
  1241  CASSIUS.
  1242  Him, and his worth, and our great need of him,
  1243  You have right well conceited. Let us go,
  1244  For it is after midnight; and, ere day,
  1245  We will awake him, and be sure of him. 
  1246  
  1247  [Exeunt.]
  1248  
  1249  
  1250  
  1251  ACT II.
  1252  
  1253  SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS'S orchard.
  1254  
  1255  [Enter Brutus.]
  1256  
  1257  BRUTUS.
  1258  What, Lucius, ho!--
  1259  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  1260  Give guess how near to day.--Lucius, I say!--
  1261  I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.--
  1262  When, Lucius, when! Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
  1263  
  1264  [Enter Lucius.]
  1265  
  1266  LUCIUS.
  1267  Call'd you, my lord?
  1268  
  1269  BRUTUS.
  1270  Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
  1271  When it is lighted, come and call me here.
  1272  
  1273  LUCIUS.
  1274  I will, my lord. 
  1275  
  1276  [Exit.]
  1277  
  1278  BRUTUS.
  1279  It must be by his death: and, for my part,
  1280  I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
  1281  But for the general. He would be crown'd:
  1282  How that might change his nature, there's the question:
  1283  It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
  1284  And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that:
  1285  And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
  1286  That at his will he may do danger with.
  1287  Th' abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
  1288  Remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Caesar,
  1289  I have not known when his affections sway'd
  1290  More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
  1291  That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
  1292  Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
  1293  But, when he once attains the upmost round,
  1294  He then unto the ladder turns his back,
  1295  Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
  1296  By which he did ascend: so Caesar may;
  1297  Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
  1298  Will bear no color for the thing he is,
  1299  Fashion it thus,--that what he is, augmented,
  1300  Would run to these and these extremities:
  1301  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
  1302  Which hatch'd, would, as his kind grow mischievous;
  1303  And kill him in the shell.
  1304  
  1305  [Re-enter Lucius.]
  1306  
  1307  LUCIUS.
  1308  The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  1309  Searching the window for a flint I found
  1310  This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure
  1311  It did not lie there when I went to bed.
  1312  
  1313  BRUTUS.
  1314  Get you to bed again; it is not day.
  1315  Is not tomorrow, boy, the Ides of March?
  1316  
  1317  LUCIUS.
  1318  I know not, sir.
  1319  
  1320  BRUTUS.
  1321  Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
  1322  
  1323  LUCIUS.
  1324  I will, sir.
  1325  
  1326  [Exit.]
  1327  
  1328  BRUTUS.
  1329  The exhalations, whizzing in the air
  1330  Give so much light that I may read by them.--
  1331  
  1332  [Opens the letter and reads.]
  1333  "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself.
  1334  Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress--!
  1335  Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!--"
  1336  
  1337  Such instigations have been often dropp'd
  1338  Where I have took them up.
  1339  "Shall Rome, & c." Thus must I piece it out:
  1340  Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
  1341  My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
  1342  The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.--
  1343  "Speak, strike, redress!"--Am I entreated, then,
  1344  To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
  1345  If the redress will follow, thou receivest
  1346  Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  1347  
  1348  [Re-enter Lucius.]
  1349  
  1350  LUCIUS.
  1351  Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  1352  
  1353  [Knocking within.]
  1354  
  1355  BRUTUS.
  1356  'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.--
  1357  
  1358  [Exit Lucius.]
  1359  
  1360  Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
  1361  I have not slept.
  1362  Between the acting of a dreadful thing
  1363  And the first motion, all the interim is
  1364  Like a phantasma or a hideous dream:
  1365  The genius and the mortal instruments
  1366  Are then in council; and the state of man,
  1367  Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
  1368  The nature of an insurrection.
  1369  
  1370  [Re-enter Lucius].
  1371  
  1372  LUCIUS.
  1373  Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  1374  Who doth desire to see you.
  1375  
  1376  BRUTUS.
  1377  Is he alone?
  1378  
  1379  LUCIUS.
  1380  No, sir, there are more with him.
  1381  
  1382  BRUTUS.
  1383  Do you know them?
  1384  
  1385  LUCIUS.
  1386  No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  1387  And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
  1388  That by no means I may discover them
  1389  By any mark of favor.
  1390  
  1391  BRUTUS.
  1392  Let 'em enter.--
  1393  
  1394  [Exit Lucius.]
  1395  They are the faction.--O conspiracy,
  1396  Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
  1397  When evils are most free? O, then, by day
  1398  Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
  1399  To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
  1400  Hide it in smiles and affability:
  1401  For if thou pass, thy native semblance on,
  1402  Not Erebus itself were dim enough
  1403  To hide thee from prevention.
  1404  
  1405  [Enter Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus Cimber, and
  1406  Trebonius.
  1407  
  1408  CASSIUS.
  1409  I think we are too bold upon your rest:
  1410  Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
  1411  
  1412  BRUTUS.
  1413  I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  1414  Know I these men that come along with you?
  1415  
  1416  CASSIUS.
  1417  Yes, every man of them; and no man here
  1418  But honors you; and every one doth wish
  1419  You had but that opinion of yourself
  1420  Which every noble Roman bears of you.
  1421  This is Trebonius.
  1422  
  1423  BRUTUS.
  1424  He is welcome hither.
  1425  
  1426  CASSIUS.
  1427  This Decius Brutus.
  1428  
  1429  BRUTUS.
  1430  He is welcome too.
  1431  
  1432  CASSIUS.
  1433  This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
  1434  
  1435  BRUTUS.
  1436  They are all welcome.--
  1437  What watchful cares do interpose themselves
  1438  Betwixt your eyes and night?
  1439  
  1440  CASSIUS.
  1441  Shall I entreat a word? 
  1442  
  1443  [BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper apart.]
  1444  
  1445  DECIUS.
  1446  Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
  1447  
  1448  CASCA.
  1449  No.
  1450  
  1451  CINNA.
  1452  O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yon grey lines
  1453  That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
  1454  
  1455  CASCA.
  1456  You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  1457  Here, as I point my sword, the Sun arises;
  1458  Which is a great way growing on the South,
  1459  Weighing the youthful season of the year.
  1460  Some two months hence, up higher toward the North
  1461  He first presents his fire; and the high East
  1462  Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
  1463  
  1464  BRUTUS.
  1465  Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  1466  
  1467  CASSIUS.
  1468  And let us swear our resolution.
  1469  
  1470  BRUTUS.
  1471  No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
  1472  The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse--
  1473  If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
  1474  And every man hence to his idle bed;
  1475  So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
  1476  Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
  1477  As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
  1478  To kindle cowards, and to steel with valour
  1479  The melting spirits of women; then, countrymen,
  1480  What need we any spur but our own cause
  1481  To prick us to redress? what other bond
  1482  Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
  1483  And will not palter? and what other oath
  1484  Than honesty to honesty engaged,
  1485  That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
  1486  Swear priests, and cowards, and men cautelous,
  1487  Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls
  1488  That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
  1489  Such creatures as men doubt: but do not stain
  1490  The even virtue of our enterprise,
  1491  Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
  1492  To think that or our cause or our performance
  1493  Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
  1494  That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
  1495  Is guilty of a several bastardy,
  1496  If he do break the smallest particle
  1497  Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
  1498  
  1499  CASSIUS.
  1500  But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  1501  I think he will stand very strong with us.
  1502  
  1503  CASCA.
  1504  Let us not leave him out.
  1505  
  1506  CINNA.
  1507  No, by no means.
  1508  
  1509  METELLUS.
  1510  O, let us have him! for his silver hairs
  1511  Will purchase us a good opinion,
  1512  And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
  1513  It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
  1514  Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
  1515  But all be buried in his gravity.
  1516  
  1517  BRUTUS.
  1518  O, name him not! let us not break with him;
  1519  For he will never follow any thing
  1520  That other men begin.
  1521  
  1522  CASSIUS.
  1523  Then leave him out.
  1524  
  1525  CASCA.
  1526  Indeed, he is not fit.
  1527  
  1528  DECIUS.
  1529  Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  1530  
  1531  CASSIUS.
  1532  Decius, well urged.--I think it is not meet,
  1533  Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
  1534  Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
  1535  A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
  1536  If he improve them, may well stretch so far
  1537  As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
  1538  Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
  1539  
  1540  BRUTUS.
  1541  Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  1542  To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,
  1543  Like wrath in death, and envy afterwards;
  1544  For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
  1545  Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
  1546  We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
  1547  And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
  1548  O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
  1549  And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
  1550  Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
  1551  Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
  1552  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
  1553  Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;
  1554  And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
  1555  Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
  1556  And after seem to chide 'em. This shall mark
  1557  Our purpose necessary, and not envious;
  1558  Which so appearing to the common eyes,
  1559  We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
  1560  And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
  1561  For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
  1562  When Caesar's head is off.
  1563  
  1564  CASSIUS.
  1565  Yet I do fear him;
  1566  For in th' ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
  1567  
  1568  BRUTUS.
  1569  Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
  1570  If he love Caesar, all that he can do
  1571  Is to himself,--take thought and die for Caesar.
  1572  And that were much he should; for he is given
  1573  To sports, to wildness, and much company.
  1574  
  1575  TREBONIUS.
  1576  There is no fear in him; let him not die;
  1577  For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
  1578  
  1579  [Clock strikes.]
  1580  
  1581  BRUTUS.
  1582  Peace! count the clock.
  1583  
  1584  CASSIUS.
  1585  The clock hath stricken three.
  1586  
  1587  TREBONIUS.
  1588  'Tis time to part.
  1589  
  1590  CASSIUS.
  1591  But it is doubtful yet
  1592  Whether Caesar will come forth today or no;
  1593  For he is superstitious grown of late,
  1594  Quite from the main opinion he held once
  1595  Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
  1596  It may be these apparent prodigies,
  1597  The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
  1598  And the persuasion of his augurers
  1599  May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
  1600  
  1601  DECIUS.
  1602  Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
  1603  I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear
  1604  That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
  1605  And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
  1606  Lions with toils, and men with flatterers:
  1607  But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
  1608  He says he does, being then most flattered.
  1609  Let me work;
  1610  For I can give his humor the true bent,
  1611  And I will bring him to the Capitol.
  1612  
  1613  CASSIUS.
  1614  Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
  1615  
  1616  BRUTUS.
  1617  By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
  1618  
  1619  CINNA.
  1620  Be that the uttermost; and fail not then.
  1621  
  1622  METELLUS.
  1623  Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
  1624  Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
  1625  I wonder none of you have thought of him.
  1626  
  1627  BRUTUS.
  1628  Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
  1629  He loves me well, and I have given him reason;
  1630  Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
  1631  
  1632  CASSIUS.
  1633  The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus;--
  1634  And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember
  1635  What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
  1636  
  1637  BRUTUS.
  1638  Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
  1639  Let not our looks put on our purposes,
  1640  But bear it as our Roman actors do,
  1641  With untired spirits and formal constancy:
  1642  And so, good morrow to you every one.--
  1643  
  1644  [Exeunt all but Brutus.]
  1645  
  1646  Boy! Lucius!--Fast asleep? It is no matter;
  1647  Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
  1648  Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
  1649  Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
  1650  Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
  1651  
  1652  [Enter Portia.]
  1653  
  1654  PORTIA.
  1655  Brutus, my lord!
  1656  
  1657  BRUTUS.
  1658  Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
  1659  It is not for your health thus to commit
  1660  Your weak condition to the raw-cold morning.
  1661  
  1662  PORTIA.
  1663  Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
  1664  Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
  1665  You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
  1666  Musing and sighing, with your arms across;
  1667  And, when I ask'd you what the matter was,
  1668  You stared upon me with ungentle looks:
  1669  I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
  1670  And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot:
  1671  Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not;
  1672  But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
  1673  Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did;
  1674  Fearing to strengthen that impatience
  1675  Which seem'd too much enkindled; and withal
  1676  Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
  1677  Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
  1678  It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;
  1679  And, could it work so much upon your shape
  1680  As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
  1681  I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
  1682  Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
  1683  
  1684  BRUTUS.
  1685  I am not well in health, and that is all.
  1686  
  1687  PORTIA.
  1688  Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
  1689  He would embrace the means to come by it.
  1690  
  1691  BRUTUS.
  1692  Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
  1693  
  1694  PORTIA.
  1695  Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
  1696  To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
  1697  Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
  1698  And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
  1699  To dare the vile contagion of the night,
  1700  And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
  1701  To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
  1702  You have some sick offense within your mind,
  1703  Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
  1704  I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
  1705  I charge you, by my once commended beauty,
  1706  By all your vows of love, and that great vow
  1707  Which did incorporate and make us one,
  1708  That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
  1709  Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
  1710  Have had resort to you; for here have been
  1711  Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
  1712  Even from darkness.
  1713  
  1714  BRUTUS.
  1715  Kneel not, gentle Portia.
  1716  
  1717  PORTIA.
  1718  I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
  1719  Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
  1720  Is it excepted I should know no secrets
  1721  That appertain to you? Am I yourself
  1722  But, as it were, in sort or limitation,--
  1723  To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
  1724  And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
  1725  Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
  1726  Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
  1727  
  1728  BRUTUS.
  1729  You are my true and honorable wife;
  1730  As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
  1731  That visit my sad heart.
  1732  
  1733  PORTIA.
  1734  If this were true, then should I know this secret.
  1735  I grant I am a woman; but withal
  1736  A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
  1737  I grant I am a woman; but withal
  1738  A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
  1739  Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
  1740  Being so father'd and so husbanded?
  1741  Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em.
  1742  I have made strong proof of my constancy,
  1743  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  1744  Here in the thigh: can I bear that with patience
  1745  And not my husband's secrets?
  1746  
  1747  BRUTUS.
  1748  O ye gods,
  1749  Render me worthy of this noble wife! 
  1750  
  1751  [Knocking within.]
  1752  
  1753  Hark, hark, one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
  1754  And by and by thy bosom shall partake
  1755  The secrets of my heart:
  1756  All my engagements I will construe to thee,
  1757  All the charactery of my sad brows.
  1758  Leave me with haste.
  1759  
  1760  [Exit Portia.]
  1761  
  1762  --Lucius, who's that knocks?
  1763  
  1764  [Re-enter Lucius with Ligarius.]
  1765  
  1766  LUCIUS.
  1767  Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
  1768  
  1769  BRUTUS.
  1770  Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.--
  1771  Boy, stand aside.--Caius Ligarius,--how?
  1772  
  1773  LIGARIUS.
  1774  Vouchsafe good-morrow from a feeble tongue.
  1775  
  1776  BRUTUS.
  1777  O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
  1778  To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
  1779  
  1780  LIGARIUS.
  1781  I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  1782  Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
  1783  
  1784  BRUTUS.
  1785  Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
  1786  Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
  1787  
  1788  LIGARIUS.
  1789  By all the gods that Romans bow before,
  1790  I here discard my sickness. Soul of Rome!
  1791  Brave son, derived from honorable loins!
  1792  Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
  1793  My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
  1794  And I will strive with things impossible;
  1795  Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
  1796  
  1797  BRUTUS.
  1798  A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
  1799  
  1800  LIGARIUS.
  1801  But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  1802  
  1803  BRUTUS.
  1804  That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
  1805  I shall unfold to thee, as we are going,
  1806  To whom it must be done.
  1807  
  1808  LIGARIUS.
  1809  Set on your foot;
  1810  And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
  1811  To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
  1812  That Brutus leads me on.
  1813  
  1814  BRUTUS.
  1815  Follow me then. 
  1816  
  1817  [Exeunt.]
  1818  
  1819  
  1820  
  1821  SCENE II.  A room in Caesar's palace.
  1822  
  1823  [Thunder and lightning. Enter Caesar, in his nightgown.]
  1824  
  1825  CAESAR.
  1826  Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight:
  1827  Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
  1828  "Help, ho! They murder Caesar!"--Who's within?
  1829  
  1830  [Enter a Servant.]
  1831  
  1832  SERVANT.
  1833  My lord?
  1834  
  1835  CAESAR.
  1836  Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
  1837  And bring me their opinions of success.
  1838  
  1839  SERVANT.
  1840  I will, my lord.
  1841  
  1842  [Exit.]
  1843  
  1844  [Enter Calpurnia.]
  1845  
  1846  CALPURNIA.
  1847  What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
  1848  You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
  1849  
  1850  CAESAR.
  1851  Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten me
  1852  Ne'er look but on my back; when they shall see
  1853  The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
  1854  
  1855  CALPURNIA.
  1856  Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
  1857  Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
  1858  Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
  1859  Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
  1860  A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
  1861  And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
  1862  Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,
  1863  In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
  1864  Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
  1865  The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
  1866  Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan;
  1867  And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
  1868  O Caesar,these things are beyond all use,
  1869  And I do fear them!
  1870  
  1871  CAESAR.
  1872  What can be avoided
  1873  Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
  1874  Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
  1875  Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
  1876  
  1877  CALPURNIA.
  1878  When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
  1879  The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
  1880  
  1881  CAESAR.
  1882  Cowards die many times before their deaths;
  1883  The valiant never taste of death but once.
  1884  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
  1885  It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
  1886  Seeing that death, a necessary end,
  1887  Will come when it will come.--
  1888  
  1889  [Re-enter Servant.]
  1890  
  1891  What say the augurers?
  1892  
  1893  SERVANT.
  1894  They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
  1895  Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
  1896  They could not find a heart within the beast.
  1897  
  1898  CAESAR.
  1899  The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
  1900  Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
  1901  If he should stay at home today for fear.
  1902  No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
  1903  That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
  1904  We are two lions litter'd in one day,
  1905  And I the elder and more terrible;
  1906  And Caesar shall go forth.
  1907  
  1908  CALPURNIA.
  1909  Alas, my lord,
  1910  Your wisdom is consumed in confidence!
  1911  Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
  1912  That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
  1913  We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate-house,
  1914  And he shall say you are not well to-day:
  1915  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
  1916  
  1917  CAESAR.
  1918  Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
  1919  And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.
  1920  
  1921  [Enter Decius.]
  1922  
  1923  Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
  1924  
  1925  DECIUS.
  1926  Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar:
  1927  I come to fetch you to the Senate-house.
  1928  
  1929  CAESAR.
  1930  And you are come in very happy time
  1931  To bear my greeting to the Senators,
  1932  And tell them that I will not come to-day.
  1933  Cannot, is false; and that I dare not, falser:
  1934  I will not come to-day. Tell them so, Decius.
  1935  
  1936  CALPURNIA.
  1937  Say he is sick.
  1938  
  1939  CAESAR.
  1940  Shall Caesar send a lie?
  1941  Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
  1942  To be afeard to tell grey-beards the truth?--
  1943  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  1944  
  1945  DECIUS.
  1946  Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
  1947  Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
  1948  
  1949  CAESAR.
  1950  The cause is in my will; I will not come:
  1951  That is enough to satisfy the Senate.
  1952  But, for your private satisfaction,
  1953  Because I love you, I will let you know:
  1954  Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
  1955  She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
  1956  Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
  1957  Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans
  1958  Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it:
  1959  And these does she apply for warnings and portents
  1960  And evils imminent; and on her knee
  1961  Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
  1962  
  1963  DECIUS.
  1964  This dream is all amiss interpreted:
  1965  It was a vision fair and fortunate.
  1966  Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
  1967  In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
  1968  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  1969  Reviving blood; and that great men shall press
  1970  For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
  1971  This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
  1972  
  1973  CAESAR.
  1974  And this way have you well expounded it.
  1975  
  1976  DECIUS.
  1977  I have, when you have heard what I can say;
  1978  And know it now: The Senate have concluded
  1979  To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
  1980  If you shall send them word you will not come,
  1981  Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
  1982  Apt to be render'd, for someone to say
  1983  "Break up the Senate till another time,
  1984  When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."
  1985  If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
  1986  "Lo, Caesar is afraid"?
  1987  Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
  1988  To your proceeding bids me tell you this;
  1989  And reason to my love is liable.
  1990  
  1991  CAESAR.
  1992  How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
  1993  I am ashamed I did yield to them.
  1994  Give me my robe, for I will go.
  1995  
  1996  [Enter Publius, Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca,
  1997  Trebonius, and Cinna.]
  1998  
  1999  And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
  2000  
  2001  PUBLIUS. 
  2002  Good morrow, Caesar.
  2003  
  2004  CAESAR.
  2005  Welcome, Publius.--
  2006  What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?--
  2007  Good morrow, Casca.--Caius Ligarius,
  2008  Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
  2009  As that same ague which hath made you lean.--
  2010  What is't o'clock?
  2011  
  2012  BRUTUS.
  2013  Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
  2014  
  2015  CAESAR.
  2016  I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
  2017  
  2018  [Enter Antony.]
  2019  
  2020  See! Antony, that revels long o'nights,
  2021  Is notwithstanding up.--Good morrow, Antony.
  2022  
  2023  ANTONY.
  2024  So to most noble Caesar.
  2025  
  2026  CAESAR.
  2027  Bid them prepare within:
  2028  I am to blame to be thus waited for.--
  2029  Now, Cinna;--now, Metellus;--what, Trebonius!
  2030  I have an hour's talk in store for you:
  2031  Remember that you call on me to-day;
  2032  Be near me, that I may remember you.
  2033  
  2034  TREBONIUS.
  2035  Caesar, I will. [Aside.] and so near will I be,
  2036  That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
  2037  
  2038  CAESAR.
  2039  Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
  2040  And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
  2041  
  2042  BRUTUS.
  2043  [Aside.] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
  2044  The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!
  2045  
  2046  [Exeunt.]
  2047  
  2048  
  2049  
  2050  SCENE III.  A street near the Capitol.
  2051  
  2052  [Enter Artemidorus, reading paper.]
  2053  
  2054  ARTEMIDORUS.
  2055  "Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come
  2056  not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark
  2057  well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast
  2058  wrong'd Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men,
  2059  and it is bent against Caesar. If thou be'st not immortal, look
  2060  about you: security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods
  2061  defend thee!
  2062  Thy lover, Artemidorus."
  2063  Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
  2064  And as a suitor will I give him this.
  2065  My heart laments that virtue cannot live
  2066  Out of the teeth of emulation.--
  2067  If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;
  2068  If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
  2069  
  2070  [Exit.]
  2071  
  2072  
  2073  
  2074  SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of
  2075  Brutus.
  2076  
  2077  [Enter Portia and Lucius.]
  2078  
  2079  PORTIA.
  2080  I pr'ythee, boy, run to the Senate-house;
  2081  Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
  2082  Why dost thou stay?
  2083  
  2084  LUCIUS.
  2085  To know my errand, madam.
  2086  
  2087  PORTIA.
  2088  I would have had thee there, and here again,
  2089  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.--
  2090  [Aside.] O constancy, be strong upon my side!
  2091  Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
  2092  I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
  2093  How hard it is for women to keep counsel!--
  2094  Art thou here yet?
  2095  
  2096  LUCIUS.
  2097  Madam, what should I do?
  2098  Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
  2099  And so return to you, and nothing else?
  2100  
  2101  PORTIA.
  2102  Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
  2103  For he went sickly forth: and take good note
  2104  What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
  2105  Hark, boy! what noise is that?
  2106  
  2107  LUCIUS.
  2108  I hear none, madam.
  2109  
  2110  PORTIA.
  2111  Pr'ythee, listen well:
  2112  I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
  2113  And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
  2114  
  2115  LUCIUS.
  2116  Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
  2117  
  2118  [Enter Artemidorus.]
  2119  
  2120  PORTIA.
  2121  Come hither, fellow:
  2122  Which way hast thou been?
  2123  
  2124  ARTEMIDORUS.
  2125  At mine own house, good lady.
  2126  
  2127  PORTIA.
  2128  What is't o'clock?
  2129  
  2130  ARTEMIDORUS.
  2131  About the ninth hour, lady.
  2132  
  2133  PORTIA.
  2134  Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
  2135  
  2136  ARTEMIDORUS.
  2137  Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand
  2138  To see him pass on to the Capitol.
  2139  
  2140  PORTIA.
  2141  Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
  2142  
  2143  ARTEMIDORUS.
  2144  That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
  2145  To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
  2146  I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
  2147  
  2148  PORTIA.
  2149  Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
  2150  
  2151  ARTEMIDORUS.
  2152  None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
  2153  Good morrow to you.--Here the street is narrow:
  2154  The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
  2155  Of Senators, of Praetors, common suitors,
  2156  Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
  2157  I'll get me to a place more void, and there
  2158  Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
  2159  
  2160  [Exit.]
  2161  
  2162  PORTIA.
  2163  I must go in.--[Aside.] Ah me, how weak a thing
  2164  The heart of woman is!--O Brutus,
  2165  The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!--
  2166  Sure, the boy heard me.--Brutus hath a suit
  2167  That Caesar will not grant.--O, I grow faint.--
  2168  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  2169  Say I am merry: come to me again,
  2170  And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
  2171  
  2172  [Exeunt.]
  2173  
  2174  
  2175  
  2176  ACT III.
  2177  
  2178  SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting.
  2179  
  2180  [A crowd of people in the street leading to the Capitol, among
  2181  them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter Caesar,
  2182  Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna,
  2183  Antony, Lepidus, Popilius, Publius, and others.]
  2184  
  2185  CAESAR.
  2186  The Ides of March are come.
  2187  
  2188  SOOTHSAYER.
  2189  Ay, Caesar; but not gone.
  2190  
  2191  ARTEMIDORUS.
  2192  Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.
  2193  
  2194  DECIUS.
  2195  Trebonius doth desire you to o'er-read,
  2196  At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
  2197  
  2198  ARTEMIDORUS.
  2199  O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
  2200  That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.
  2201  
  2202  CAESAR.
  2203  What touches us ourself shall be last served.
  2204  
  2205  ARTEMIDORUS.
  2206  Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
  2207  
  2208  CAESAR.
  2209  What, is the fellow mad?
  2210  
  2211  PUBLIUS.
  2212  Sirrah, give place.
  2213  
  2214  CASSIUS.
  2215  What, urge you your petitions in the street?
  2216  Come to the Capitol.
  2217  
  2218  [Caesar enters the Capitol, the rest following. All the Senators
  2219  rise.]
  2220  
  2221  POPILIUS.
  2222  I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
  2223  
  2224  CASSIUS.
  2225  What enterprise, Popilius?
  2226  
  2227  POPILIUS.
  2228  Fare you well.
  2229  Advances to Caesar.
  2230  
  2231  BRUTUS.
  2232  What said Popilius Lena?
  2233  
  2234  CASSIUS.
  2235  He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
  2236  I fear our purpose is discovered.
  2237  
  2238  BRUTUS.
  2239  Look, how he makes to Caesar: mark him.
  2240  
  2241  CASSIUS.
  2242  Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.--
  2243  Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
  2244  Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
  2245  For I will slay myself.
  2246  
  2247  BRUTUS.
  2248  Cassius, be constant:
  2249  Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
  2250  For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
  2251  
  2252  CASSIUS.
  2253  Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,
  2254  He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
  2255  
  2256  [Exeunt Antony and Trebonius. Caesar and the Senators take their
  2257  seats.]
  2258  
  2259  DECIUS.
  2260  Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
  2261  And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
  2262  
  2263  BRUTUS.
  2264  He is address'd; press near and second him.
  2265  
  2266  CINNA.
  2267  Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
  2268  
  2269  CASCA.
  2270  Are we all ready?
  2271  
  2272  CAESAR.
  2273  What is now amiss
  2274  That Caesar and his Senate must redress?
  2275  
  2276  METELLUS.
  2277  Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
  2278  Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
  2279  An humble heart.
  2280  
  2281  [Kneeling.]
  2282  
  2283  CAESAR.
  2284  I must prevent thee, Cimber.
  2285  These couchings and these lowly courtesies
  2286  Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
  2287  And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
  2288  Into the law of children. Be not fond,
  2289  To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
  2290  That will be thaw'd from the true quality
  2291  With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
  2292  Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel-fawning.
  2293  Thy brother by decree is banished:
  2294  If thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him,
  2295  I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
  2296  
  2297  METELLUS.
  2298  Caesar, thou dost me wrong.
  2299  
  2300  CAESAR.
  2301  Caesar did never wrong but with just cause,
  2302  Nor without cause will he be satisfied.
  2303  
  2304  METELLUS.
  2305  Is there no voice more worthy than my own,
  2306  To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
  2307  For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
  2308  
  2309  BRUTUS.
  2310  I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
  2311  Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
  2312  Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
  2313  
  2314  CAESAR.
  2315  What, Brutus?
  2316  
  2317  CASSIUS.
  2318  Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
  2319  As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
  2320  To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
  2321  
  2322  CAESAR.
  2323  I could be well moved, if I were as you;
  2324  If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
  2325  But I am constant as the northern star,
  2326  Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
  2327  There is no fellow in the firmament.
  2328  The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
  2329  They are all fire, and every one doth shine;
  2330  But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
  2331  So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
  2332  And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
  2333  Yet in the number I do know but one
  2334  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  2335  Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
  2336  Let me a little show it, even in this,--
  2337  That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
  2338  And constant do remain to keep him so.
  2339  
  2340  CINNA.
  2341  O Caesar,--
  2342  
  2343  CAESAR.
  2344  Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
  2345  
  2346  DECIUS.
  2347  Great Caesar,--
  2348  
  2349  CAESAR.
  2350  Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
  2351  
  2352  CASCA.
  2353  Speak, hands, for me!
  2354  
  2355  [Casca stabs Caesar in the neck. Caesar catches hold of his arm.
  2356  He is then stabbed by several other Conspirators, and at last by
  2357  Marcus Brutus.]
  2358  
  2359  CAESAR.
  2360  Et tu, Brute?-- Then fall, Caesar!
  2361  
  2362  [Dies. The Senators and People retire in confusion.]
  2363  
  2364  CINNA.
  2365  Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!--
  2366  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  2367  
  2368  CASSIUS.
  2369  Some to the common pulpits and cry out,
  2370  "Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"
  2371  
  2372  BRUTUS.
  2373  People and Senators, be not affrighted;
  2374  Fly not; stand still; ambition's debt is paid.
  2375  
  2376  CASCA.
  2377  Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
  2378  
  2379  DECIUS.
  2380  And Cassius too.
  2381  
  2382  BRUTUS.
  2383  Where's Publius?
  2384  
  2385  CINNA.
  2386  Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
  2387  
  2388  METELLUS.
  2389  Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
  2390  Should chance--
  2391  
  2392  BRUTUS.
  2393  Talk not of standing.--Publius, good cheer!
  2394  There is no harm intended to your person,
  2395  Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.
  2396  
  2397  CASSIUS.
  2398  And leave us, Publius; lest that the people
  2399  Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
  2400  
  2401  BRUTUS.
  2402  Do so;--and let no man abide this deed
  2403  But we the doers.
  2404  
  2405  [Re-enter Trebonius.]
  2406  
  2407  CASSIUS.
  2408  Where's Antony?
  2409  
  2410  TREBONIUS.
  2411  Fled to his house amazed.
  2412  Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run,
  2413  As it were doomsday.
  2414  
  2415  BRUTUS.
  2416  Fates, we will know your pleasures:
  2417  That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
  2418  And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
  2419  
  2420  CASCA.
  2421  Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
  2422  Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
  2423  
  2424  BRUTUS.
  2425  Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
  2426  So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
  2427  His time of fearing death.--Stoop, Romans, stoop,
  2428  And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
  2429  Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
  2430  Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
  2431  And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
  2432  Let's all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"
  2433  
  2434  CASSIUS.
  2435  Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence
  2436  Shall this our lofty scene be acted o'er
  2437  In States unborn and accents yet unknown!
  2438  
  2439  BRUTUS.
  2440  How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
  2441  That now on Pompey's basis lies along
  2442  No worthier than the dust!
  2443  
  2444  CASSIUS.
  2445  So oft as that shall be,
  2446  So often shall the knot of us be call'd
  2447  The men that gave their country liberty.
  2448  
  2449  DECIUS.
  2450  What, shall we forth?
  2451  
  2452  CASSIUS.
  2453  Ay, every man away:
  2454  Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
  2455  With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
  2456  
  2457  BRUTUS.
  2458  Soft, who comes here?
  2459  
  2460  [Enter a Servant.]
  2461  
  2462  A friend of Antony's.
  2463  
  2464  SERVANT.
  2465  Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel;
  2466  Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
  2467  And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
  2468  Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
  2469  Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving;
  2470  Say I love Brutus and I honor him;
  2471  Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him, and loved him.
  2472  If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
  2473  May safely come to him, and be resolved
  2474  How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
  2475  Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
  2476  So well as Brutus living; but will follow
  2477  The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
  2478  Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
  2479  With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
  2480  
  2481  BRUTUS.
  2482  Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
  2483  I never thought him worse.
  2484  Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
  2485  He shall be satisfied and, by my honour,
  2486  Depart untouch'd.
  2487  
  2488  SERVANT.
  2489  I'll fetch him presently. 
  2490  
  2491  [Exit.]
  2492  
  2493  BRUTUS.
  2494  I know that we shall have him well to friend.
  2495  
  2496  CASSIUS.
  2497  I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
  2498  That fears him much; and my misgiving still
  2499  Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
  2500  
  2501  BRUTUS.
  2502  But here comes Antony.--
  2503  
  2504  [Re-enter Antony.]
  2505  
  2506  Welcome, Mark Antony.
  2507  
  2508  ANTONY.
  2509  O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
  2510  Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
  2511  Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.--
  2512  I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
  2513  Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
  2514  If I myself, there is no hour so fit
  2515  As Caesar's death-hour, nor no instrument
  2516  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  2517  With the most noble blood of all this world.
  2518  I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
  2519  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  2520  Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
  2521  I shall not find myself so apt to die:
  2522  No place will please me so, no means of death,
  2523  As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
  2524  The choice and master spirits of this age.
  2525  
  2526  BRUTUS.
  2527  O Antony, beg not your death of us!
  2528  Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
  2529  As, by our hands and this our present act
  2530  You see we do; yet see you but our hands
  2531  And this the bleeding business they have done:
  2532  Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
  2533  And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
  2534  As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
  2535  Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
  2536  To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;
  2537  Our arms in strength of amity, and our hearts
  2538  Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
  2539  With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
  2540  
  2541  CASSIUS.
  2542  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  2543  In the disposing of new dignities.
  2544  
  2545  BRUTUS.
  2546  Only be patient till we have appeased
  2547  The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
  2548  And then we will deliver you the cause
  2549  Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
  2550  Have thus proceeded.
  2551  
  2552  ANTONY.
  2553  I doubt not of your wisdom.
  2554  Let each man render me his bloody hand:
  2555  First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;--
  2556  Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;--
  2557  Now, Decius Brutus, yours;--now yours, Metellus;--
  2558  Yours, Cinna;--and, my valiant Casca, yours;--
  2559  Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
  2560  Gentlemen all--alas, what shall I say?
  2561  My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
  2562  That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
  2563  Either a coward or a flatterer.--
  2564  That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
  2565  If then thy spirit look upon us now,
  2566  Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
  2567  To see thy Antony making his peace,
  2568  Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,--
  2569  Most noble!--in the presence of thy corse?
  2570  Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
  2571  Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
  2572  It would become me better than to close
  2573  In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
  2574  Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
  2575  Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
  2576  Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy death.--
  2577  O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
  2578  And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.--
  2579  How like a deer strucken by many princes,
  2580  Dost thou here lie!
  2581  
  2582  CASSIUS.
  2583  Mark Antony,--
  2584  
  2585  ANTONY.
  2586  Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
  2587  The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
  2588  Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
  2589  
  2590  CASSIUS.
  2591  I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
  2592  But what compact mean you to have with us?
  2593  Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,
  2594  Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
  2595  
  2596  ANTONY.
  2597  Therefore I took your hands; but was indeed
  2598  Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
  2599  Friends am I with you all, and love you all,
  2600  Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
  2601  Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
  2602  
  2603  BRUTUS.
  2604  Or else were this a savage spectacle:
  2605  Our reasons are so full of good regard
  2606  That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
  2607  You should be satisfied.
  2608  
  2609  ANTONY.
  2610  That's all I seek:
  2611  And am moreover suitor that I may
  2612  Produce his body to the market-place;
  2613  And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
  2614  Speak in the order of his funeral.
  2615  
  2616  BRUTUS.
  2617  You shall, Mark Antony.
  2618  
  2619  CASSIUS.
  2620  Brutus, a word with you.
  2621  [Aside to Brutus.] You know not what you do; do not consent
  2622  That Antony speak in his funeral:
  2623  Know you how much the people may be moved
  2624  By that which he will utter?
  2625  
  2626  BRUTUS.
  2627  [Aside to Cassius.] By your pardon:
  2628  I will myself into the pulpit first,
  2629  And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
  2630  What Antony shall speak, I will protest
  2631  He speaks by leave and by permission;
  2632  And that we are contented Caesar shall
  2633  Have all true rights and lawful ceremonies.
  2634  It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
  2635  
  2636  CASSIUS.
  2637  [Aside to Brutus.] I know not what may fall; I like it not.
  2638  
  2639  BRUTUS.
  2640  Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
  2641  You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
  2642  But speak all good you can devise of Caesar;
  2643  And say you do't by our permission;
  2644  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  2645  About his funeral: and you shall speak
  2646  In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
  2647  After my speech is ended.
  2648  
  2649  ANTONY.
  2650  Be it so;
  2651  I do desire no more.
  2652  
  2653  BRUTUS.
  2654  Prepare the body, then, and follow us.
  2655  
  2656  [Exeunt all but Antony.]
  2657  
  2658  ANTONY.
  2659  O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  2660  That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
  2661  Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
  2662  That ever lived in the tide of times.
  2663  Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
  2664  Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
  2665  Which, like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
  2666  To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,--
  2667  A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
  2668  Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
  2669  Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
  2670  Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
  2671  And dreadful objects so familiar,
  2672  That mothers shall but smile when they behold
  2673  Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
  2674  All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
  2675  And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
  2676  With Ate' by his side come hot from Hell,
  2677  Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
  2678  Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
  2679  That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
  2680  With carrion men, groaning for burial.--
  2681  
  2682  [Enter a Servant].
  2683  
  2684  You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
  2685  
  2686  SERVANT.
  2687  I do, Mark Antony.
  2688  
  2689  ANTONY.
  2690  Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
  2691  
  2692  SERVANT.
  2693  He did receive his letters, and is coming;
  2694  And bid me say to you by word of mouth,--
  2695  [Seeing the body.] O Caesar!--
  2696  
  2697  ANTONY.
  2698  Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
  2699  Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
  2700  Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
  2701  Began to water. Is thy master coming?
  2702  
  2703  SERVANT.
  2704  He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
  2705  
  2706  ANTONY.
  2707  Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced.
  2708  Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
  2709  No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
  2710  Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile;
  2711  Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
  2712  Into the market-place: there shall I try,
  2713  In my oration, how the people take
  2714  The cruel issue of these bloody men;
  2715  According to the which thou shalt discourse
  2716  To young Octavius of the state of things.
  2717  Lend me your hand. 
  2718  
  2719  [Exeunt with Caesar's body.]
  2720  
  2721  
  2722  
  2723  SCENE II. The same. The Forum.
  2724  
  2725  [Enter Brutus and Cassius, with a throng of Citizens.]
  2726  
  2727  CITIZENS.
  2728  We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
  2729  
  2730  BRUTUS.
  2731  Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.--
  2732  Cassius, go you into the other street
  2733  And part the numbers.--
  2734  Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
  2735  Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
  2736  And public reasons shall be rendered
  2737  Of Caesar's death.
  2738  
  2739  FIRST CITIZEN.
  2740  I will hear Brutus speak.
  2741  
  2742  SECOND CITIZEN.
  2743  I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
  2744  When severally we hear them rendered.
  2745  
  2746  [Exit Cassius, with some of the Citizens. Brutus goes into the
  2747  rostrum.]
  2748  
  2749  THIRD CITIZEN.
  2750  The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
  2751  
  2752  BRUTUS.
  2753  Be patient till the last.
  2754  Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause; and be
  2755  silent, that you may hear: believe me for mine honour, and have
  2756  respect to mine honor, that you may believe: censure me in your
  2757  wisdom; and awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
  2758  If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to
  2759  him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his. If
  2760  then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is
  2761  my answer,--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome
  2762  more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than
  2763  that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I
  2764  weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
  2765  valiant, I honour him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him.
  2766  There is tears for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his
  2767  valour; and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that
  2768  would be a bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who
  2769  is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him
  2770  have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his
  2771  country? If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a
  2772  reply.
  2773  
  2774  CITIZENS.
  2775  None, Brutus, none.
  2776  
  2777  BRUTUS.
  2778  Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar
  2779  than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is
  2780  enroll'd in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he
  2781  was worthy;, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered
  2782  death.
  2783  
  2784  [Enter Antony and others, with Caesar's body.]
  2785  
  2786  Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had
  2787  no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a
  2788  place in the commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
  2789  I depart-- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I
  2790  have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country
  2791  to need my death.
  2792  
  2793  CITIZENS.
  2794  Live, Brutus! live, live!
  2795  
  2796  FIRST CITIZEN.
  2797  Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
  2798  
  2799  SECOND CITIZEN.
  2800  Give him a statue with his ancestors.
  2801  
  2802  THIRD CITIZEN.
  2803  Let him be Caesar.
  2804  
  2805  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  2806  Caesar's better parts
  2807  Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
  2808  
  2809  FIRST CITIZEN.
  2810  We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours.
  2811  
  2812  BRUTUS.
  2813  My countrymen,--
  2814  
  2815  SECOND CITIZEN.
  2816  Peace! silence! Brutus speaks.
  2817  
  2818  FIRST CITIZEN.
  2819  Peace, ho!
  2820  
  2821  BRUTUS.
  2822  Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
  2823  And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
  2824  Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
  2825  Tending to Caesar's glory; which Mark Antony,
  2826  By our permission, is allow'd to make.
  2827  I do entreat you, not a man depart,
  2828  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  2829  
  2830  [Exit.]
  2831  
  2832  FIRST CITIZEN.
  2833  Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.
  2834  
  2835  THIRD CITIZEN.
  2836  Let him go up into the public chair;
  2837  We'll hear him.--Noble Antony, go up.
  2838  
  2839  ANTONY.
  2840  For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
  2841  
  2842  [Goes up.]
  2843  
  2844  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  2845  What does he say of Brutus?
  2846  
  2847  THIRD CITIZEN.
  2848  He says, for Brutus' sake,
  2849  He finds himself beholding to us all.
  2850  
  2851  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  2852  'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
  2853  
  2854  FIRST CITIZEN.
  2855  This Caesar was a tyrant.
  2856  
  2857  THIRD CITIZEN.
  2858  Nay, that's certain:
  2859  We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
  2860  
  2861  SECOND CITIZEN.
  2862  Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
  2863  
  2864  ANTONY.
  2865  You gentle Romans,--
  2866  
  2867  CITIZENS.
  2868  Peace, ho! let us hear him.
  2869  
  2870  ANTONY.
  2871  Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
  2872  I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
  2873  The evil that men do lives after them;
  2874  The good is oft interred with their bones:
  2875  So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
  2876  Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
  2877  If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
  2878  And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
  2879  Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,--
  2880  For Brutus is an honourable man;
  2881  So are they all, all honorable men,--
  2882  Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
  2883  He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
  2884  But Brutus says he was ambitious;
  2885  And Brutus is an honourable man.
  2886  He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
  2887  Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
  2888  Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
  2889  When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
  2890  Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
  2891  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
  2892  And Brutus is an honourable man.
  2893  You all did see that on the Lupercal
  2894  I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
  2895  Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
  2896  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
  2897  And, sure, he is an honourable man.
  2898  I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
  2899  But here I am to speak what I do know.
  2900  You all did love him once,--not without cause:
  2901  What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?--
  2902  O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
  2903  And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
  2904  My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
  2905  And I must pause till it come back to me.
  2906  
  2907  FIRST CITIZEN.
  2908  Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
  2909  
  2910  SECOND CITIZEN.
  2911  If thou consider rightly of the matter,
  2912  Caesar has had great wrong.
  2913  
  2914  THIRD CITIZEN.
  2915  Has he not, masters?
  2916  I fear there will a worse come in his place.
  2917  
  2918  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  2919  Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
  2920  Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
  2921  
  2922  FIRST CITIZEN.
  2923  If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
  2924  
  2925  SECOND CITIZEN.
  2926  Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
  2927  
  2928  THIRD CITIZEN.
  2929  There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
  2930  
  2931  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  2932  Now mark him; he begins again to speak.
  2933  
  2934  ANTONY.
  2935  But yesterday the word of Caesar might
  2936  Have stood against the world: now lies he there,
  2937  And none so poor to do him reverence.
  2938  O masters, if I were disposed to stir
  2939  Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
  2940  I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,
  2941  Who, you all know, are honourable men:
  2942  I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
  2943  To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,
  2944  Than I will wrong such honourable men.
  2945  But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar,--
  2946  I found it in his closet,--'tis his will:
  2947  Let but the commons hear this testament,--
  2948  Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,--
  2949  And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds,
  2950  And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;
  2951  Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
  2952  And, dying, mention it within their wills,
  2953  Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
  2954  Unto their issue.
  2955  
  2956  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  2957  We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
  2958  
  2959  CITIZENS.
  2960  The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.
  2961  
  2962  ANTONY.
  2963  Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
  2964  It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
  2965  You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
  2966  And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
  2967  It will inflame you, it will make you mad.
  2968  'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
  2969  For if you should, O, what would come of it!
  2970  
  2971  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  2972  Read the will! we'll hear it, Antony;
  2973  You shall read us the will,--Caesar's will!
  2974  
  2975  ANTONY.
  2976  Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
  2977  I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
  2978  I fear I wrong the honorable men
  2979  Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
  2980  
  2981  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  2982  They were traitors: honourable men!
  2983  
  2984  CITIZENS.
  2985  The will! The testament!
  2986  
  2987  SECOND CITIZEN.
  2988  They were villains, murderers. The will! read the will!
  2989  
  2990  ANTONY.
  2991  You will compel me, then, to read the will?
  2992  Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
  2993  And let me show you him that made the will.
  2994  Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
  2995  
  2996  CITIZENS.
  2997  Come down.
  2998  
  2999  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3000  Descend.
  3001  
  3002  [He comes down.]
  3003  
  3004  THIRD CITIZEN.
  3005  You shall have leave.
  3006  
  3007  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  3008  A ring! stand round.
  3009  
  3010  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3011  Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
  3012  
  3013  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3014  Room for Antony!--most noble Antony!
  3015  
  3016  ANTONY.
  3017  Nay, press not so upon me; stand far' off.
  3018  
  3019  CITIZENS.
  3020  Stand back; room! bear back.
  3021  
  3022  ANTONY.
  3023  If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
  3024  You all do know this mantle: I remember
  3025  The first time ever Caesar put it on;
  3026  'Twas on a Summer's evening, in his tent,
  3027  That day he overcame the Nervii.
  3028  Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
  3029  See what a rent the envious Casca made:
  3030  Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
  3031  And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
  3032  Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,--
  3033  As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
  3034  If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
  3035  For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
  3036  Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
  3037  This was the most unkindest cut of all;
  3038  For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
  3039  Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
  3040  Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
  3041  And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
  3042  Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
  3043  Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
  3044  O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
  3045  Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
  3046  Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
  3047  O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
  3048  The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
  3049  Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
  3050  Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
  3051  Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
  3052  
  3053  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3054  O piteous spectacle!
  3055  
  3056  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3057  O noble Caesar!
  3058  
  3059  THIRD CITIZEN.
  3060  O woeful day!
  3061  
  3062  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  3063  O traitors, villains!
  3064  
  3065  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3066  O most bloody sight!
  3067  
  3068  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3069  We will be revenged.
  3070  
  3071  CITIZENS.
  3072  Revenge,--about,--seek,--burn,--fire,--kill,--slay,--let not a
  3073  traitor live!
  3074  
  3075  ANTONY.
  3076  Stay, countrymen.
  3077  
  3078  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3079  Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
  3080  
  3081  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3082  We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
  3083  
  3084  ANTONY.
  3085  Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
  3086  To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
  3087  They that have done this deed are honourable:
  3088  What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
  3089  That made them do it; they're wise and honourable,
  3090  And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
  3091  I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
  3092  I am no orator, as Brutus is;
  3093  But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
  3094  That love my friend; and that they know full well
  3095  That gave me public leave to speak of him:
  3096  For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
  3097  Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
  3098  To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
  3099  I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
  3100  Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor dumb mouths,
  3101  And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
  3102  And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
  3103  Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
  3104  In every wound of Caesar, that should move
  3105  The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
  3106  
  3107  CITIZENS.
  3108  We'll mutiny.
  3109  
  3110  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3111  We'll burn the house of Brutus.
  3112  
  3113  THIRD CITIZEN.
  3114  Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
  3115  
  3116  ANTONY.
  3117  Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
  3118  
  3119  CITIZENS.
  3120  Peace, ho! hear Antony; most noble Antony!
  3121  
  3122  ANTONY.
  3123  Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
  3124  Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
  3125  Alas, you know not; I must tell you then:
  3126  You have forgot the will I told you of.
  3127  
  3128  CITIZENS.
  3129  Most true; the will!--let's stay, and hear the will.
  3130  
  3131  ANTONY.
  3132  Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
  3133  To every Roman citizen he gives,
  3134  To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
  3135  
  3136  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3137  Most noble Caesar!--we'll revenge his death.
  3138  
  3139  THIRD CITIZEN.
  3140  O, royal Caesar!
  3141  
  3142  ANTONY.
  3143  Hear me with patience.
  3144  
  3145  CITIZENS.
  3146  Peace, ho!
  3147  
  3148  ANTONY.
  3149  Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
  3150  His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,
  3151  On this side Tiber: he hath left them you,
  3152  And to your heirs forever; common pleasures,
  3153  To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
  3154  Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
  3155  
  3156  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3157  Never, never.--Come, away, away!
  3158  We'll burn his body in the holy place,
  3159  And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
  3160  Take up the body.
  3161  
  3162  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3163  Go, fetch fire.
  3164  
  3165  THIRD CITIZEN.
  3166  Pluck down benches.
  3167  
  3168  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  3169  Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
  3170  
  3171  [Exeunt Citizens, with the body.]
  3172  
  3173  ANTONY.
  3174  Now let it work.--Mischief, thou art afoot,
  3175  Take thou what course thou wilt!--
  3176  
  3177  [Enter a Servant.]
  3178  
  3179  How now, fellow?
  3180  
  3181  SERVANT.
  3182  Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
  3183  
  3184  ANTONY.
  3185  Where is he?
  3186  
  3187  SERVANT.
  3188  He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
  3189  
  3190  ANTONY.
  3191  And thither will I straight to visit him:
  3192  He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
  3193  And in this mood will give us any thing.
  3194  
  3195  SERVANT.
  3196  I heard 'em say Brutus and Cassius
  3197  Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
  3198  
  3199  ANTONY.
  3200  Belike they had some notice of the people,
  3201  How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
  3202  
  3203  [Exeunt.]
  3204  
  3205  
  3206  
  3207  SCENE III.  The same. A street.
  3208  
  3209  [Enter Cinna, the poet.]
  3210  
  3211  CINNA.
  3212  I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
  3213  And things unluckily charge my fantasy:
  3214  I have no will to wander forth of doors,
  3215  Yet something leads me forth.
  3216  
  3217  [Enter Citizens.]
  3218  
  3219  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3220  What is your name?
  3221  
  3222  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3223  Whither are you going?
  3224  
  3225  THIRD CITIZEN.
  3226  Where do you dwell?
  3227  
  3228  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  3229  Are you a married man or a bachelor?
  3230  
  3231  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3232  Answer every man directly.
  3233  
  3234  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3235  Ay, and briefly.
  3236  
  3237  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  3238  Ay, and wisely.
  3239  
  3240  THIRD CITIZEN.
  3241  Ay, and truly; you were best.
  3242  
  3243  CINNA.
  3244  What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I
  3245  a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly
  3246  and briefly, wisely and truly. Wisely I say I am a bachelor.
  3247  
  3248  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3249  That's as much as to say they are fools that marry; you'll bear
  3250  me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.
  3251  
  3252  CINNA.
  3253  Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
  3254  
  3255  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3256  As a friend, or an enemy?
  3257  
  3258  CINNA.
  3259  As a friend.
  3260  
  3261  SECOND CITIZEN.
  3262  That matter is answered directly.
  3263  
  3264  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  3265  For your dwelling,--briefly.
  3266  
  3267  CINNA.
  3268  Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
  3269  
  3270  THIRD CITIZEN.
  3271  Your name, sir, truly.
  3272  
  3273  CINNA.
  3274  Truly, my name is Cinna.
  3275  
  3276  FIRST CITIZEN.
  3277  Tear him to pieces! he's a conspirator.
  3278  
  3279  CINNA.
  3280  I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
  3281  
  3282  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  3283  Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
  3284  
  3285  CINNA.
  3286  I am not Cinna the conspirator.
  3287  
  3288  FOURTH CITIZEN.
  3289  It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
  3290  name out of his heart, and turn him going.
  3291  
  3292  THIRD CITIZEN.
  3293  Tear him, tear him! Come; brands, ho! firebrands. To
  3294  Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all. Some to Decius' house, and some
  3295  to Casca's, some to Ligarius': away, go!

  3298

  3300  
  3301  ACT IV.
  3302  
  3303  SCENE I. Rome. A room in Antony's house.
  3304  
  3305  [Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.]
  3306  
  3307  ANTONY.
  3308  These many then shall die; their names are prick'd.
  3309  
  3310  OCTAVIUS.
  3311  Your brother too must die: consent you, Lepidus?
  3312  
  3313  LEPIDUS.
  3314  I do consent,--
  3315  
  3316  OCTAVIUS.
  3317  Prick him down, Antony.
  3318  
  3319  LEPIDUS.
  3320  --Upon condition Publius shall not live,
  3321  Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
  3322  
  3323  ANTONY.
  3324  He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
  3325  But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
  3326  Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
  3327  How to cut off some charge in legacies.
  3328  
  3329  LEPIDUS.
  3330  What, shall I find you here?
  3331  
  3332  OCTAVIUS.
  3333  Or here, or at the Capitol.
  3334  
  3335  [Exit Lepidus.]
  3336  
  3337  ANTONY.
  3338  This is a slight unmeritable man,
  3339  Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
  3340  The three-fold world divided, he should stand
  3341  One of the three to share it?
  3342  
  3343  OCTAVIUS.
  3344  So you thought him;
  3345  And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
  3346  In our black sentence and proscription.
  3347  
  3348  ANTONY.
  3349  Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
  3350  And, though we lay these honors on this man,
  3351  To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
  3352  He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
  3353  To groan and sweat under the business,
  3354  Either led or driven, as we point the way;
  3355  And having brought our treasure where we will,
  3356  Then take we down his load and turn him off,
  3357  Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears
  3358  And graze in commons.
  3359  
  3360  OCTAVIUS.
  3361  You may do your will;
  3362  But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
  3363  
  3364  ANTONY.
  3365  So is my horse, Octavius;and for that
  3366  I do appoint him store of provender:
  3367  It is a creature that I teach to fight,
  3368  To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
  3369  His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
  3370  And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
  3371  He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth:
  3372  A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
  3373  On objects, arts, and imitations,
  3374  Which, out of use and staled by other men,
  3375  Begin his fashion: do not talk of him
  3376  But as a property. And now, Octavius,
  3377  Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius
  3378  Are levying powers: we must straight make head;
  3379  Therefore let our alliance be combined,
  3380  Our best friends made, our means stretch'd;
  3381  And let us presently go sit in council,
  3382  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  3383  And open perils surest answered.
  3384  
  3385  OCTAVIUS.
  3386  Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
  3387  And bay'd about with many enemies;
  3388  And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
  3389  Millions of mischiefs.
  3390  
  3391  [Exeunt.]
  3392  
  3393  
  3394  
  3395  SCENE II. Before Brutus' tent, in the camp near Sardis.
  3396  
  3397  [Drum. Enter Brutus, Lucilius, Titinius, and Soldiers; Pindarus
  3398  meeting them; Lucius at some distance.]
  3399  
  3400  BRUTUS.
  3401  Stand, ho!
  3402  
  3403  LUCILIUS. 
  3404  Give the word, ho! and stand.
  3405  
  3406  BRUTUS.
  3407  What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
  3408  
  3409  LUCILIUS. 
  3410  He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
  3411  To do you salutation from his master.
  3412  
  3413  [Pindarus gives a letter to Brutus.]
  3414  
  3415  BRUTUS.
  3416  He greets me well.--Your master, Pindarus,
  3417  In his own change, or by ill officers,
  3418  Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
  3419  Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
  3420  I shall be satisfied.
  3421  
  3422  PINDARUS.
  3423  I do not doubt
  3424  But that my noble master will appear
  3425  Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
  3426  
  3427  BRUTUS.
  3428  He is not doubted.--A word, Lucilius:
  3429  How he received you, let me be resolved.
  3430  
  3431  LUCILIUS. 
  3432  With courtesy and with respect enough;
  3433  But not with such familiar instances,
  3434  Nor with such free and friendly conference,
  3435  As he hath used of old.
  3436  
  3437  BRUTUS.
  3438  Thou hast described
  3439  A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
  3440  When love begins to sicken and decay,
  3441  It useth an enforced ceremony.
  3442  There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
  3443  But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
  3444  Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
  3445  But, when they should endure the bloody spur,
  3446  They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades
  3447  Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
  3448  
  3449  LUCILIUS.
  3450  They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd:
  3451  The greater part, the Horse in general,
  3452  Are come with Cassius.
  3453  
  3454  [March within.]
  3455  
  3456  BRUTUS.
  3457  Hark! he is arrived.
  3458  March gently on to meet him.
  3459  
  3460  [Enter Cassius and Soldiers.]
  3461  
  3462  CASSIUS.
  3463  Stand, ho!
  3464  
  3465  BRUTUS.
  3466  Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
  3467  
  3468  FIRST SOLDIER.
  3469  Stand!
  3470  
  3471  SECOND SOLDIER.
  3472  Stand!
  3473  
  3474  THIRD SOLDIER.
  3475  Stand!
  3476  
  3477  CASSIUS.
  3478  Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
  3479  
  3480  BRUTUS.
  3481  Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
  3482  And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
  3483  
  3484  CASSIUS.
  3485  Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
  3486  And when you do them--
  3487  
  3488  BRUTUS.
  3489  Cassius, be content;
  3490  Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.
  3491  Before the eyes of both our armies here,
  3492  Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
  3493  Let us not wrangle; bid them move away;
  3494  Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
  3495  And I will give you audience.
  3496  
  3497  CASSIUS.
  3498  Pindarus,
  3499  Bid our commanders lead their charges off
  3500  A little from this ground.
  3501  
  3502  BRUTUS.
  3503  Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
  3504  Come to our tent till we have done our conference.--
  3505  Lucius and Titinius, guard our door.
  3506  
  3507  [Exeunt.]
  3508  
  3509  
  3510  
  3511  SCENE III. within the tent of Brutus.
  3512  
  3513  [Enter Brutus and Cassius.]
  3514  
  3515  CASSIUS.
  3516  That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
  3517  You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
  3518  For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
  3519  Whereas my letters, praying on his side
  3520  Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
  3521  
  3522  BRUTUS.
  3523  You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
  3524  
  3525  CASSIUS.
  3526  In such a time as this it is not meet
  3527  That every nice offense should bear his comment.
  3528  
  3529  BRUTUS.
  3530  Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
  3531  Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,
  3532  To sell and mart your offices for gold
  3533  To undeservers.
  3534  
  3535  CASSIUS.
  3536  I an itching palm!
  3537  You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
  3538  Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
  3539  
  3540  BRUTUS.
  3541  The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
  3542  And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
  3543  
  3544  CASSIUS.
  3545  Chastisement!
  3546  
  3547  BRUTUS.
  3548  Remember March, the Ides of March remember:
  3549  Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
  3550  What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
  3551  And not for justice? What! shall one of us,
  3552  That struck the foremost man of all this world
  3553  But for supporting robbers,--shall we now
  3554  Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
  3555  And sell the mighty space of our large honours
  3556  For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
  3557  I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
  3558  Than such a Roman.
  3559  
  3560  CASSIUS.
  3561  Brutus, bay not me,
  3562  I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
  3563  To hedge me in; I am a soldier, ay,
  3564  Older in practice, abler than yourself
  3565  To make conditions.
  3566  
  3567  BRUTUS.
  3568  Go to; you are not, Cassius.
  3569  
  3570  CASSIUS.
  3571  I am.
  3572  
  3573  BRUTUS.
  3574  I say you are not.
  3575  
  3576  CASSIUS.
  3577  Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
  3578  Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.
  3579  
  3580  BRUTUS.
  3581  Away, slight man!
  3582  
  3583  CASSIUS.
  3584  Is't possible?
  3585  
  3586  BRUTUS.
  3587  Hear me, for I will speak.
  3588  Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
  3589  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
  3590  
  3591  CASSIUS.
  3592  O gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?
  3593  
  3594  BRUTUS.
  3595  All this? ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
  3596  Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
  3597  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  3598  Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
  3599  Under your testy humour? By the gods,
  3600  You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
  3601  Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
  3602  I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
  3603  When you are waspish.
  3604  
  3605  CASSIUS.
  3606  Is it come to this?
  3607  
  3608  BRUTUS.
  3609  You say you are a better soldier:
  3610  Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
  3611  And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
  3612  I shall be glad to learn of abler men.
  3613  
  3614  CASSIUS.
  3615  You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
  3616  I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
  3617  Did I say "better"?
  3618  
  3619  BRUTUS.
  3620  If you did, I care not.
  3621  
  3622  CASSIUS.
  3623  When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
  3624  
  3625  BRUTUS.
  3626  Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
  3627  
  3628  CASSIUS.
  3629  I durst not?
  3630  
  3631  BRUTUS.
  3632  No.
  3633  
  3634  CASSIUS.
  3635  What, durst not tempt him?
  3636  
  3637  BRUTUS.
  3638  For your life you durst not.
  3639  
  3640  CASSIUS.
  3641  Do not presume too much upon my love;
  3642  I may do that I shall be sorry for.
  3643  
  3644  BRUTUS.
  3645  You have done that you should be sorry for.
  3646  There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
  3647  For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,
  3648  That they pass by me as the idle wind
  3649  Which I respect not. I did send to you
  3650  For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;--
  3651  For I can raise no money by vile means:
  3652  By Heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
  3653  And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
  3654  From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
  3655  By any indirection:--I did send
  3656  To you for gold to pay my legions,
  3657  Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
  3658  Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
  3659  When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
  3660  To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
  3661  Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
  3662  Dash him to pieces!
  3663  
  3664  CASSIUS.
  3665  I denied you not.
  3666  
  3667  BRUTUS.
  3668  You did.
  3669  
  3670  CASSIUS.
  3671  I did not. He was but a fool
  3672  That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
  3673  A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
  3674  But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
  3675  
  3676  BRUTUS.
  3677  I do not, till you practise them on me.
  3678  
  3679  CASSIUS.
  3680  You love me not.
  3681  
  3682  BRUTUS.
  3683  I do not like your faults.
  3684  
  3685  CASSIUS.
  3686  A friendly eye could never see such faults.
  3687  
  3688  BRUTUS.
  3689  A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
  3690  As huge as high Olympus.
  3691  
  3692  CASSIUS.
  3693  Come, Antony and young Octavius, come,
  3694  Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
  3695  For Cassius is a-weary of the world;
  3696  Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
  3697  Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
  3698  Set in a note-book, learn'd and conn'd by rote,
  3699  To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
  3700  My spirit from mine eyes!--There is my dagger,
  3701  And here my naked breast; within, a heart
  3702  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
  3703  If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
  3704  I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
  3705  Strike as thou didst at Caesar; for I know,
  3706  When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
  3707  Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
  3708  
  3709  BRUTUS.
  3710  Sheathe your dagger:
  3711  Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
  3712  Do what you will, dishonor shall be humour.
  3713  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  3714  That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
  3715  Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
  3716  And straight is cold again.
  3717  
  3718  CASSIUS.
  3719  Hath Cassius lived
  3720  To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
  3721  When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?
  3722  
  3723  BRUTUS.
  3724  When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
  3725  
  3726  CASSIUS.
  3727  Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
  3728  
  3729  BRUTUS.
  3730  And my heart too.
  3731  
  3732  CASSIUS.
  3733  O Brutus,--
  3734  
  3735  BRUTUS.
  3736  What's the matter?
  3737  
  3738  CASSIUS.
  3739  --Have not you love enough to bear with me,
  3740  When that rash humor which my mother gave me
  3741  Makes me forgetful?
  3742  
  3743  BRUTUS.
  3744  Yes, Cassius; and from henceforth,
  3745  When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
  3746  He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
  3747  
  3748  [Noise within.]
  3749  
  3750  POET.
  3751  [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals:
  3752  There is some grudge between 'em; 'tis not meet
  3753  They be alone.
  3754  
  3755  LUCILIUS. 
  3756  [Within.] You shall not come to them.
  3757  
  3758  POET.
  3759  [Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.
  3760  
  3761  [Enter Poet, followed by Lucilius, and Titinius.]
  3762  
  3763  CASSIUS.
  3764  How now! What's the matter?
  3765  
  3766  POET.
  3767  For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
  3768  Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
  3769  For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
  3770  
  3771  CASSIUS.
  3772  Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  3773  
  3774  BRUTUS.
  3775  Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
  3776  
  3777  CASSIUS.
  3778  Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
  3779  
  3780  BRUTUS.
  3781  I'll know his humor when he knows his time:
  3782  What should the wars do with these jigging fools?--
  3783  Companion, hence!
  3784  
  3785  CASSIUS.
  3786  Away, away, be gone!
  3787  
  3788  [Exit Poet.]
  3789  
  3790  BRUTUS.
  3791  Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
  3792  Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
  3793  
  3794  CASSIUS.
  3795  And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
  3796  Immediately to us.
  3797  
  3798  [Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.]
  3799  
  3800  BRUTUS.
  3801  Lucius, a bowl of wine!
  3802  
  3803  [Exit Lucius.]
  3804  
  3805  CASSIUS.
  3806  I did not think you could have been so angry.
  3807  
  3808  BRUTUS.
  3809  O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  3810  
  3811  CASSIUS.
  3812  Of your philosophy you make no use,
  3813  If you give place to accidental evils.
  3814  
  3815  BRUTUS.
  3816  No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
  3817  
  3818  CASSIUS.
  3819  Ha! Portia!
  3820  
  3821  BRUTUS.
  3822  She is dead.
  3823  
  3824  CASSIUS.
  3825  How 'scaped I killing, when I cross'd you so?--
  3826  O insupportable and touching loss!--
  3827  Upon what sickness?
  3828  
  3829  BRUTUS.
  3830  Impatient of my absence,
  3831  And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
  3832  Have made themselves so strong;--for with her death
  3833  That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
  3834  And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
  3835  
  3836  CASSIUS.
  3837  And died so?
  3838  
  3839  BRUTUS.
  3840  Even so.
  3841  
  3842  CASSIUS.
  3843  O ye immortal gods!
  3844  
  3845  [Re-enter Lucius, with wine and a taper.]
  3846  
  3847  BRUTUS.
  3848  Speak no more of her.--Give me a bowl of wine.--
  3849  In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
  3850  
  3851  [Drinks.]
  3852  
  3853  CASSIUS.
  3854  My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  3855  Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
  3856  I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
  3857  
  3858  [Drinks.]
  3859  
  3860  BRUTUS.
  3861  Come in, Titinius!--
  3862  
  3863  [Exit Lucius.]
  3864  
  3865  [Re-enter Titinius, with Messala.]
  3866  
  3867  Welcome, good Messala.--
  3868  Now sit we close about this taper here,
  3869  And call in question our necessities.
  3870  
  3871  CASSIUS.
  3872  Portia, art thou gone?
  3873  
  3874  BRUTUS.
  3875  No more, I pray you.--
  3876  Messala, I have here received letters,
  3877  That young Octavius and Mark Antony
  3878  Come down upon us with a mighty power,
  3879  Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
  3880  
  3881  MESSALA.
  3882  Myself have letters of the selfsame tenour.
  3883  
  3884  BRUTUS.
  3885  With what addition?
  3886  
  3887  MESSALA.
  3888  That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  3889  Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
  3890  Have put to death an hundred Senators.
  3891  
  3892  BRUTUS.
  3893  There in our letters do not well agree:
  3894  Mine speak of seventy Senators that died
  3895  By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
  3896  
  3897  CASSIUS.
  3898  Cicero one!
  3899  
  3900  MESSALA.
  3901  Cicero is dead,
  3902  And by that order of proscription.--
  3903  Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
  3904  
  3905  BRUTUS.
  3906  No, Messala.
  3907  
  3908  MESSALA.
  3909  Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  3910  
  3911  BRUTUS.
  3912  Nothing, Messala.
  3913  
  3914  MESSALA.
  3915  That, methinks, is strange.
  3916  
  3917  BRUTUS.
  3918  Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
  3919  
  3920  MESSALA.
  3921  No, my lord.
  3922  
  3923  BRUTUS.
  3924  Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  3925  
  3926  MESSALA.
  3927  Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  3928  For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
  3929  
  3930  BRUTUS.
  3931  Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
  3932  With meditating that she must die once,
  3933  I have the patience to endure it now.
  3934  
  3935  MESSALA.
  3936  Even so great men great losses should endure.
  3937  
  3938  CASSIUS.
  3939  I have as much of this in art as you,
  3940  But yet my nature could not bear it so.
  3941  
  3942  BRUTUS.
  3943  Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  3944  Of marching to Philippi presently?
  3945  
  3946  CASSIUS.
  3947  I do not think it good.
  3948  
  3949  BRUTUS.
  3950  Your reason?
  3951  
  3952  CASSIUS.
  3953  This it is:
  3954  'Tis better that the enemy seek us;:
  3955  So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
  3956  Doing himself offense; whilst we, lying still,
  3957  Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
  3958  
  3959  BRUTUS.
  3960  Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
  3961  The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
  3962  Do stand but in a forced affection;
  3963  For they have grudged us contribution:
  3964  The enemy, marching along by them,
  3965  By them shall make a fuller number up,
  3966  Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
  3967  From which advantage shall we cut him off,
  3968  If at Philippi we do face him there,
  3969  These people at our back.
  3970  
  3971  CASSIUS.
  3972  Hear me, good brother.
  3973  
  3974  BRUTUS.
  3975  Under your pardon. You must note besides,
  3976  That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
  3977  Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
  3978  The enemy increaseth every day;
  3979  We, at the height, are ready to decline.
  3980  There is a tide in the affairs of men
  3981  Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
  3982  Omitted, all the voyage of their life
  3983  Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
  3984  On such a full sea are we now afloat;
  3985  And we must take the current when it serves,
  3986  Or lose our ventures.
  3987  
  3988  CASSIUS.
  3989  Then, with your will, go on:
  3990  We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
  3991  
  3992  BRUTUS.
  3993  The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
  3994  And nature must obey necessity;
  3995  Which we will niggard with a little rest.
  3996  There is no more to say?
  3997  
  3998  CASSIUS.
  3999  No more. Good night:
  4000  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  4001  
  4002  BRUTUS.
  4003  Lucius!--My gown.--Farewell now, good Messala:--
  4004  Good night, Titinius:--noble, noble Cassius,
  4005  Good night, and good repose.
  4006  
  4007  CASSIUS.
  4008  O my dear brother!
  4009  This was an ill beginning of the night.
  4010  Never come such division 'tween our souls!
  4011  Let it not, Brutus.
  4012  
  4013  BRUTUS.
  4014  Every thing is well.
  4015  
  4016  CASSIUS.
  4017  Good night, my lord.
  4018  
  4019  BRUTUS.
  4020  Good night, good brother.
  4021  
  4022  TITINIUS. MESSALA.
  4023  Good night, Lord Brutus.
  4024  
  4025  BRUTUS.
  4026  Farewell, everyone.--
  4027  
  4028  [Exeunt Cassius, Titinius, and Messala.]
  4029  
  4030  [Re-enter Lucius, with the gown.]
  4031  
  4032  Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
  4033  
  4034  LUCIUS.
  4035  Here in the tent.
  4036  
  4037  BRUTUS.
  4038  What, thou speak'st drowsily:
  4039  Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'er-watch'd.
  4040  Call Claudius and some other of my men;
  4041  I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
  4042  
  4043  LUCIUS.
  4044  Varro and Claudius!
  4045  
  4046  [Enter Varro and Claudius.]
  4047  
  4048  VARRO.
  4049  Calls my lord?
  4050  
  4051  BRUTUS.
  4052  I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
  4053  It may be I shall raise you by-and-by
  4054  On business to my brother Cassius.
  4055  
  4056  VARRO.
  4057  So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  4058  
  4059  BRUTUS.
  4060  I would not have it so; lie down, good sirs:
  4061  It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.--
  4062  Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
  4063  I put it in the pocket of my gown.
  4064  
  4065  [Servants lie down.]
  4066  
  4067  LUCIUS.
  4068  I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  4069  
  4070  BRUTUS.
  4071  Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  4072  Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
  4073  And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
  4074  
  4075  LUCIUS.
  4076  Ay, my lord, an't please you.
  4077  
  4078  BRUTUS.
  4079  It does, my boy:
  4080  I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
  4081  
  4082  LUCIUS.
  4083  It is my duty, sir.
  4084  
  4085  BRUTUS.
  4086  I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
  4087  I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
  4088  
  4089  LUCIUS.
  4090  I have slept, my lord, already.
  4091  
  4092  BRUTUS.
  4093  It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
  4094  I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
  4095  I will be good to thee.--
  4096  
  4097  [Lucius plays and sings till he falls asleep.]
  4098   
  4099  This is a sleepy tune.--O murderous Slumber,
  4100  Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
  4101  That plays thee music?--Gentle knave, good night;
  4102  I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
  4103  If thou dost nod, thou breakst thy instrument;
  4104  I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.--
  4105  Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
  4106  Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
  4107  
  4108  [Enter the Ghost of Caesar.]
  4109  
  4110  How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
  4111  I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
  4112  That shapes this monstrous apparition.
  4113  It comes upon me.--Art thou any thing?
  4114  Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
  4115  That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
  4116  Speak to me what thou art.
  4117  
  4118  GHOST.
  4119  Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  4120  
  4121  BRUTUS.
  4122  Why comest thou?
  4123  
  4124  GHOST.
  4125  To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
  4126  
  4127  BRUTUS.
  4128  Well; then I shall see thee again?
  4129  
  4130  GHOST.
  4131  Ay, at Philippi.
  4132  
  4133  BRUTUS.
  4134  Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
  4135  
  4136  [Ghost vanishes.]
  4137  Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest:
  4138  Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.--
  4139  Boy! Lucius!--Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake!--Claudius!
  4140  
  4141  LUCIUS.
  4142  The strings, my lord, are false.
  4143  
  4144  BRUTUS.
  4145  He thinks he still is at his instrument.--
  4146  Lucius, awake!
  4147  
  4148  LUCIUS.
  4149  My lord?
  4150  
  4151  BRUTUS.
  4152  Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  4153  
  4154  LUCIUS.
  4155  My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  4156  
  4157  BRUTUS.
  4158  Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
  4159  
  4160  LUCIUS.
  4161  Nothing, my lord.
  4162  
  4163  BRUTUS.
  4164  Sleep again, Lucius.--Sirrah Claudius!--
  4165  [To Varro.] Fellow thou, awake!
  4166  
  4167  VARRO.
  4168  My lord?
  4169  
  4170  CLAUDIUS.
  4171  My lord?
  4172  
  4173  BRUTUS.
  4174  Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
  4175  
  4176  VARRO. CLAUDIUS.
  4177  Did we, my lord?
  4178  
  4179  BRUTUS.
  4180  Ay: saw you any thing?
  4181  
  4182  VARRO.
  4183  No, my lord, I saw nothing.
  4184  
  4185  CLAUDIUS.
  4186  Nor I, my lord.
  4187  
  4188  BRUTUS.
  4189  Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
  4190  Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
  4191  And we will follow.
  4192  
  4193  VARRO. CLAUDIUS.
  4194  It shall be done, my lord.
  4195  
  4196  [Exeunt.]
  4197  
  4198  
  4199  
  4200  ACT V.
  4201  
  4202  SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.
  4203  
  4204  [Enter Octavius, Antony, and their Army.]
  4205  
  4206  OCTAVIUS.
  4207  Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
  4208  You said the enemy would not come down,
  4209  But keep the hills and upper regions:
  4210  It proves not so; their battles are at hand:
  4211  They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
  4212  Answering before we do demand of them.
  4213  
  4214  ANTONY.
  4215  Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  4216  Wherefore they do it: they could be content
  4217  To visit other places; and come down
  4218  With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
  4219  To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
  4220  But 'tis not so.
  4221  
  4222  [Enter a Messenger.]
  4223  
  4224  MESSENGER. 
  4225  Prepare you, generals:
  4226  The enemy comes on in gallant show;
  4227  Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
  4228  And something to be done immediately.
  4229  
  4230  ANTONY.
  4231  Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  4232  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  4233  
  4234  OCTAVIUS.
  4235  Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
  4236  
  4237  ANTONY.
  4238  Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  4239  
  4240  OCTAVIUS.
  4241  I do not cross you; but I will do so.
  4242  
  4243  [March. Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their Army;
  4244  Lucilius, Titinius, Messala, and Others.]
  4245  
  4246  BRUTUS.
  4247  They stand, and would have parley.
  4248  
  4249  CASSIUS.
  4250  Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.
  4251  
  4252  OCTAVIUS.
  4253  Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  4254  
  4255  ANTONY.
  4256  No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  4257  Make forth; the generals would have some words.
  4258  
  4259  OCTAVIUS.
  4260  Stir not until the signal.
  4261  
  4262  BRUTUS.
  4263  Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?
  4264  
  4265  OCTAVIUS.
  4266  Not that we love words better, as you do.
  4267  
  4268  BRUTUS.
  4269  Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  4270  
  4271  ANTONY.
  4272  In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
  4273  Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
  4274  Crying, "Long live! Hail, Caesar!"
  4275  
  4276  CASSIUS.
  4277  Antony,
  4278  The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
  4279  But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
  4280  And leave them honeyless.
  4281  
  4282  ANTONY.
  4283  Not stingless too.
  4284  
  4285  BRUTUS.
  4286  O, yes, and soundless too,
  4287  For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
  4288  And very wisely threat before you sting.
  4289  
  4290  ANTONY.
  4291  Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers
  4292  Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
  4293  You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
  4294  And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
  4295  Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
  4296  Struck Caesar on the neck. O flatterers!
  4297  
  4298  CASSIUS.
  4299  Flatterers!--Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
  4300  This tongue had not offended so to-day,
  4301  If Cassius might have ruled.
  4302  
  4303  OCTAVIUS.
  4304  Come, come, the cause: if arguing makes us sweat,
  4305  The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
  4306  Look,--
  4307  I draw a sword against conspirators:
  4308  When think you that the sword goes up again?
  4309  Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
  4310  Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
  4311  Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
  4312  
  4313  BRUTUS.
  4314  Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  4315  Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
  4316  
  4317  OCTAVIUS.
  4318  So I hope;
  4319  I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
  4320  
  4321  BRUTUS.
  4322  O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  4323  Young man, thou couldst not die more honourably.
  4324  
  4325  CASSIUS.
  4326  A peevish school boy, worthless of such honour,
  4327  Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
  4328  
  4329  ANTONY.
  4330  Old Cassius still!
  4331  
  4332  OCTAVIUS.
  4333  Come, Antony; away!--
  4334  Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
  4335  If you dare fight today, come to the field;
  4336  If not, when you have stomachs.
  4337  
  4338  [Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their Army.]
  4339  
  4340  CASSIUS.
  4341  Why, now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!
  4342  The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
  4343  
  4344  BRUTUS.
  4345  Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  4346  
  4347  LUCILIUS.
  4348  My lord?
  4349  
  4350  [Brutus and Lucilius talk apart.]
  4351  
  4352  CASSIUS.
  4353  Messala,--
  4354  
  4355  MESSALA.
  4356  What says my General?
  4357  
  4358  CASSIUS.
  4359  Messala,
  4360  This is my birth-day; as this very day
  4361  Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
  4362  Be thou my witness that against my will,
  4363  As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
  4364  Upon one battle all our liberties.
  4365  You know that I held Epicurus strong,
  4366  And his opinion: now I change my mind,
  4367  And partly credit things that do presage.
  4368  Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
  4369  Two mighty eagles fell; and there they perch'd,
  4370  Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
  4371  Who to Philippi here consorted us:
  4372  This morning are they fled away and gone;
  4373  And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites
  4374  Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
  4375  As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
  4376  A canopy most fatal, under which
  4377  Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
  4378  
  4379  MESSALA.
  4380  Believe not so.
  4381  
  4382  CASSIUS.
  4383  I but believe it partly;
  4384  For I am fresh of spirit, and resolved
  4385  To meet all perils very constantly.
  4386  
  4387  BRUTUS.
  4388  Even so, Lucilius.
  4389  
  4390  CASSIUS.
  4391  Now, most noble Brutus,
  4392  The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
  4393  Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
  4394  But, since th' affairs of men rest still incertain,
  4395  Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
  4396  If we do lose this battle, then is this
  4397  The very last time we shall speak together:
  4398  What are you then determined to do?
  4399  
  4400  BRUTUS.
  4401  Even by the rule of that philosophy
  4402  By which I did blame Cato for the death
  4403  Which he did give himself;--I know not how,
  4404  But I do find it cowardly and vile,
  4405  For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
  4406  The time of life;--arming myself with patience
  4407  To stay the providence of some high powers
  4408  That govern us below.
  4409  
  4410  CASSIUS.
  4411  Then, if we lose this battle,
  4412  You are contented to be led in triumph
  4413  Thorough the streets of Rome?
  4414  
  4415  BRUTUS.
  4416  No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
  4417  That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
  4418  He bears too great a mind. But this same day
  4419  Must end that work the Ides of March begun;
  4420  And whether we shall meet again I know not.
  4421  Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
  4422  For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
  4423  If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
  4424  If not, why, then this parting was well made.
  4425  
  4426  CASSIUS.
  4427  For ever and for ever farewell, Brutus!
  4428  If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
  4429  If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
  4430  
  4431  BRUTUS.
  4432  Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  4433  The end of this day's business ere it come!
  4434  But it sufficeth that the day will end,
  4435  And then the end is known.--Come, ho! away!
  4436  
  4437  [Exeunt.]
  4438  
  4439  
  4440  
  4441  SCENE II.  The same. The field of battle.
  4442  
  4443  [Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.]
  4444  
  4445  BRUTUS.
  4446  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  4447  Unto the legions on the other side:
  4448  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  4449  But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
  4450  And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
  4451  Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
  4452  
  4453  [Exeunt.]
  4454  
  4455  
  4456  
  4457  SCENE III. Another part of the field.
  4458  
  4459  [Alarum. Enter Cassius and Titinius.]
  4460  
  4461  CASSIUS.
  4462  O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  4463  Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
  4464  This ensign here of mine was turning back;
  4465  I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
  4466  
  4467  TITINIUS.
  4468  O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
  4469  Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
  4470  Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
  4471  Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  4472  
  4473  [Enter Pindarus.]
  4474  
  4475  PINDARUS.
  4476  Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  4477  Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord:
  4478  Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far' off.
  4479  
  4480  CASSIUS.
  4481  This hill is far enough.--Look, look, Titinius;
  4482  Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
  4483  
  4484  TITINIUS.
  4485  They are, my lord.
  4486  
  4487  CASSIUS.
  4488  Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  4489  Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,
  4490  Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
  4491  And here again; that I may rest assured
  4492  Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
  4493  
  4494  TITINIUS.
  4495  I will be here again, even with a thought.
  4496  
  4497  [Exit.]
  4498  
  4499  CASSIUS.
  4500  Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill:
  4501  My sight was ever thick: regard Titinius,
  4502  And tell me what thou notest about the field.--
  4503  
  4504  [Pindarus goes up.]
  4505  
  4506  This day I breathed first: time is come round,
  4507  And where I did begin, there shall I end;
  4508  My life is run his compass.--Sirrah, what news?
  4509  
  4510  PINDARUS.
  4511  [Above.] O my lord!
  4512  
  4513  CASSIUS.
  4514  What news?
  4515  
  4516  PINDARUS.
  4517  [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
  4518  With horsemen, that make to him on the spur:
  4519  Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.--
  4520  Now, Titinius!--Now some 'light. O, he 'lights too:
  4521  He's ta'en; [Shout.] and, hark! they shout for joy.
  4522  
  4523  CASSIUS.
  4524  Come down; behold no more.--
  4525  O, coward that I am, to live so long,
  4526  To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
  4527  
  4528  [Pindarus descends.]
  4529  
  4530  Come hither, sirrah:
  4531  In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
  4532  And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
  4533  That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
  4534  Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
  4535  Now be a freeman; and with this good sword,
  4536  That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
  4537  Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
  4538  And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
  4539  Guide thou the sword.--Caesar, thou art revenged,
  4540  Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
  4541  
  4542  [Dies.]
  4543  
  4544  PINDARUS.
  4545  So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  4546  Durst I have done my will.--O Cassius!
  4547  Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
  4548  Where never Roman shall take note of him.
  4549  
  4550  [Exit.]
  4551  
  4552  [Re-enter Titinius with Messala.]
  4553  
  4554  MESSALA.
  4555  It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
  4556  Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
  4557  As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
  4558  
  4559  TITINIUS.
  4560  These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  4561  
  4562  MESSALA.
  4563  Where did you leave him?
  4564  
  4565  TITINIUS.
  4566  All disconsolate,
  4567  With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
  4568  
  4569  MESSALA.
  4570  Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  4571  
  4572  TITINIUS.
  4573  He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  4574  
  4575  MESSALA.
  4576  Is not that he?
  4577  
  4578  TITINIUS.
  4579  No, this was he, Messala,
  4580  But Cassius is no more.--O setting Sun,
  4581  As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,
  4582  So in his red blood Cassius' day is set,
  4583  The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
  4584  Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
  4585  Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
  4586  
  4587  MESSALA.
  4588  Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  4589  O hateful Error, Melancholy's child!
  4590  Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
  4591  The things that are not? O Error, soon conceived,
  4592  Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
  4593  But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
  4594  
  4595  TITINIUS.
  4596  What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?
  4597  
  4598  MESSALA.
  4599  Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  4600  The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
  4601  Into his ears: I may say, thrusting it;
  4602  For piercing steel and darts envenomed
  4603  Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
  4604  As tidings of this sight.
  4605  
  4606  TITINIUS.
  4607  Hie you, Messala,
  4608  And I will seek for Pindarus the while.--
  4609  
  4610  [Exit Messala.]
  4611  Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
  4612  Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
  4613  Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
  4614  And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
  4615  Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
  4616  But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
  4617  Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
  4618  Will do his bidding.--Brutus, come apace,
  4619  And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.--
  4620  By your leave, gods: this is a Roman's part:
  4621  Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
  4622  
  4623  [Dies.]
  4624  
  4625  [Alarum. Re-enter Messala, with Brutus, young Cato,
  4626  Strato, Volumnius, and Lucilius.]
  4627  
  4628  BRUTUS.
  4629  Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
  4630  
  4631  MESSALA.
  4632  Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
  4633  
  4634  BRUTUS.
  4635  Titinius' face is upward.
  4636  
  4637  CATO.
  4638  He is slain.
  4639  
  4640  BRUTUS.
  4641  O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  4642  Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords
  4643  In our own proper entrails.
  4644  
  4645  [Low alarums.]
  4646  
  4647  CATO.
  4648  Brave Titinius!
  4649  Look whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
  4650  
  4651  BRUTUS.
  4652  Are yet two Romans living such as these?--
  4653  The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
  4654  It is impossible that ever Rome
  4655  Should breed thy fellow.--Friends, I owe more tears
  4656  To this dead man than you shall see me pay.--
  4657  I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.--
  4658  Come therefore, and to Thassos send his body:
  4659  His funerals shall not be in our camp,
  4660  Lest it discomfort us.--Lucilius, come;--
  4661  And come, young Cato;--let us to the field.--
  4662  Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:--
  4663  'Tis three o'clock; and Romans, yet ere night
  4664  We shall try fortune in a second fight. 
  4665  
  4666  [Exeunt.]
  4667  
  4668  
  4669  
  4670  SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
  4671  
  4672  [Alarum. Enter, fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then Brutus,
  4673  young Cato, Lucilius, and Others.]
  4674  
  4675  BRUTUS.
  4676  Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  4677  
  4678  CATO.
  4679  What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
  4680  I will proclaim my name about the field:--
  4681  I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
  4682  A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
  4683  I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
  4684  
  4685  [Charges the enemy.]
  4686  
  4687  BRUTUS.
  4688  And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
  4689  Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
  4690  
  4691  [Exit, charging the enemy. Cato is overpowered, and falls.]
  4692  
  4693  LUCILIUS.
  4694  O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  4695  Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
  4696  And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.
  4697  
  4698  FIRST SOLDIER.
  4699  Yield, or thou diest.
  4700  
  4701  LUCILIUS.
  4702  Only I yield to die:
  4703  There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
  4704  [Offering money.] 
  4705  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
  4706  
  4707  FIRST SOLDIER.
  4708  We must not. A noble prisoner!
  4709  
  4710  SECOND SOLDIER.
  4711  Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
  4712  
  4713  FIRST SOLDIER.
  4714  I'll tell the news. Here comes the General.--
  4715  
  4716  [Enter Antony.]
  4717  
  4718  Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
  4719  
  4720  ANTONY.
  4721  Where is he?
  4722  
  4723  LUCILIUS.
  4724  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  4725  I dare assure thee that no enemy
  4726  Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
  4727  The gods defend him from so great a shame!
  4728  When you do find him, or alive or dead,
  4729  He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
  4730  
  4731  ANTONY.
  4732  This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
  4733  A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
  4734  Give him all kindness; I had rather have
  4735  Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
  4736  And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
  4737  And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
  4738  How everything is chanced.
  4739  
  4740  [Exeunt.]
  4741  
  4742  
  4743  
  4744  SCENE V. Another part of the field.
  4745  
  4746  [Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.]
  4747  
  4748  BRUTUS.
  4749  Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  4750  
  4751  CLITUS.
  4752  Statilius show'd the torch-light; but, my lord,
  4753  He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.
  4754  
  4755  BRUTUS.
  4756  Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
  4757  It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
  4758  
  4759  [Whispering.]
  4760  
  4761  CLITUS.
  4762  What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  4763  
  4764  BRUTUS.
  4765  Peace then! no words.
  4766  
  4767  CLITUS.
  4768  I'll rather kill myself.
  4769  
  4770  BRUTUS.
  4771  Hark thee, Dardanius.
  4772  
  4773  [Whispers him.]
  4774  
  4775  DARDANIUS.
  4776  Shall I do such a deed?
  4777  
  4778  CLITUS.
  4779  O Dardanius!
  4780  
  4781  DARDANIUS.
  4782  O Clitus!
  4783  
  4784  CLITUS.
  4785  What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  4786  
  4787  DARDANIUS.
  4788  To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  4789  
  4790  CLITUS.
  4791  Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  4792  That it runs over even at his eyes.
  4793  
  4794  BRUTUS.
  4795  Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.
  4796  
  4797  VOLUMNIUS.
  4798  What says my lord?
  4799  
  4800  BRUTUS.
  4801  Why, this, Volumnius:
  4802  The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
  4803  Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
  4804  And this last night here in Philippi fields:
  4805  I know my hour is come.
  4806  
  4807  VOLUMNIUS.
  4808  Not so, my lord.
  4809  
  4810  BRUTUS.
  4811  Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  4812  Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
  4813  Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
  4814  
  4815  [Low alarums.]
  4816  
  4817  It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
  4818  Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
  4819  Thou know'st that we two went to school together;
  4820  Even for that our love of old, I pr'ythee,
  4821  Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
  4822  
  4823  VOLUMNIUS.
  4824  That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  4825  
  4826  [Alarums still.]
  4827  
  4828  CLITUS.
  4829  Fly, fly, my lord! there is no tarrying here.
  4830  
  4831  BRUTUS.
  4832  Farewell to you;--and you;--and you, Volumnius.--
  4833  Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
  4834  Farewell to thee too, Strato.--Countrymen,
  4835  My heart doth joy, that yet in all my life
  4836  I found no man but he was true to me.
  4837  I shall have glory by this losing day,
  4838  More than Octavius and Mark Antony
  4839  By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
  4840  So, fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
  4841  Hath almost ended his life's history:
  4842  Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest
  4843  That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
  4844  
  4845  [Alarums. Cry within, "Fly, fly, fly!"]
  4846  
  4847  CLITUS.
  4848  Fly, my lord, fly!
  4849  
  4850  BRUTUS.
  4851  Hence! I will follow.--
  4852  
  4853  [Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius.]
  4854  
  4855  I pr'ythee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
  4856  Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
  4857  Thy life hath had some smack of honor in it:
  4858  Hold, then, my sword, and turn away thy face,
  4859  While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
  4860  
  4861  STRATO.
  4862  Give me your hand first: fare you well, my lord.
  4863  
  4864  BRUTUS.
  4865  Farewell, good Strato.--Caesar, now be still:
  4866  I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
  4867  
  4868  [He runs on his sword, and dies.]
  4869  
  4870  [Alarum. Retreat. Enter Octavius, Antony, Messala, Lucilius, and
  4871  Army.]
  4872  
  4873  OCTAVIUS.
  4874  What man is that?
  4875  
  4876  MESSALA.
  4877  My master's man.--Strato, where is thy master?
  4878  
  4879  STRATO.
  4880  Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
  4881  The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
  4882  For Brutus only overcame himself,
  4883  And no man else hath honour by his death.
  4884  
  4885  LUCILIUS.
  4886  So Brutus should be found.--I thank thee, Brutus,
  4887  That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
  4888  
  4889  OCTAVIUS.
  4890  All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.--
  4891  Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
  4892  
  4893  STRATO.
  4894  Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
  4895  
  4896  OCTAVIUS.
  4897  Do so, good Messala.
  4898  
  4899  MESSALA.
  4900  How died my master, Strato?
  4901  
  4902  STRATO.
  4903  I held the sword, and he did run on it.
  4904  
  4905  MESSALA.
  4906  Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
  4907  That did the latest service to my master.
  4908  
  4909  ANTONY.
  4910  This was the noblest Roman of them all:
  4911  All the conspirators, save only he,
  4912  Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
  4913  He only, in a general-honest thought
  4914  And common good to all, made one of them.
  4915  His life was gentle; and the elements
  4916  So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
  4917  And say to all the world, "This was a man!"
  4918  
  4919  OCTAVIUS.
  4920  According to his virtue let us use him
  4921  With all respect and rites of burial.
  4922  Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
  4923  Most like a soldier, order'd honorably.--
  4924  So, call the field to rest; and let's away,
  4925  To part the glories of this happy day. 
  4926

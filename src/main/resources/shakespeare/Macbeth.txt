    41  Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
    42  all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
    43  copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
    44  of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
    45  
    46  
    47  We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
    48  of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
    49  
    50  Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
    51  midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
    52  The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
    53  Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
    54  preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
    55  and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
    56  up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
    57  in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
    58  a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
    59  look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
    60  new copy has at least one byte more or less.

    63  Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
    64  
    65  We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
    66  time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
    67  to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
    68  searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
    69  projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
    70  per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
    71  million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
    72  files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
    73  If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
    74  total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
    75  
    76  The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
    77  Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
    78  This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
    79  which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
    80  
    81  At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
    82  of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
    83  manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
    84  from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
    85  assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
    86  more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
    87  don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

   147  Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
   148  They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
   149  your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
   150  someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
   151  fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
   152  disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
   153  you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
   154  
   155  *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
   156  By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
   157  etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
   158  this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
   159  a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
   160  sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
   161  you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
   162  medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
   163  
   164  ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
   165  This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
   166  tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
   167  Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
   168  Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
   169  things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
   170  on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
   171  distribute it in the United States without permission and
   172  without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
   173  below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
   174  under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
   175  
   176  To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
   177  efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
   178  works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
   179  medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
   180  things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
   181  corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
   182  intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
   183  disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
   184  codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
   185  
   186  LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
   187  But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
   188  [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
   189  etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
   190  liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
   191  legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
   192  UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
   193  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   194  OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
   195  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   196  
   197  If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
   198  receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
   199  you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
   200  time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
   201  on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
   202  such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
   203  copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
   204  choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
   205  receive it electronically.
   206  
   207  THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
   208  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS

   210  LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   211  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   212  
   213  Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
   214  the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
   215  above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
   216  may have other legal rights.

   254  
   255       [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
   256            no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

   291  Executive Director's Notes:
   292  
   293  In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
   294  the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
   295  been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
   296  are presented herein:
   297  
   298    Barnardo. Who's there?
   299    Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
   300  your selfe
   301  
   302     Bar. Long liue the King
   303  
   304  ***
   305  
   306  As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
   307  or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
   308  original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
   309  to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
   310  that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
   311  above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
   312  Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .
   313  
   314  The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
   315  time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
   316  place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
   317  as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
   318  more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
   319  
   320  You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
   321  have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
   322  extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
   323  very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
   324  assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
   325  in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
   326  purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
   327  . . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
   328  that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
   329  variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
   330  for signing his name with several different spellings.
   331  
   332  So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
   333  made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
   334  that are "not" errors. . . .
   335  
   336  So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
   337  here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie 
   338  of Macbeth.

   347  
   348  Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
   349  a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
   350  come in ASCII to the printed text.
   351  
   352  The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
   353  conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
   354  punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
   355  printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
   356  together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
   357  Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
   358  spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
   359  abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
   360  brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
   361  you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
   362  purer Shakespeare.
   363  
   364  Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
   365  differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
   366  be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
   367  this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
   368  habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
   369  then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
   370  continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
   371  incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
   372  The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
   373  First Folio editions' best pages.
   374  
   375  If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
   376  errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
   377  free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
   378  etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
   379  and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.

   422  Say to the King, the knowledge of the Broyle,
   423  As thou didst leaue it
   424  
   425     Cap. Doubtfull it stood,
   426  As two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,
   427  And choake their Art: The mercilesse Macdonwald
   428  (Worthie to be a Rebell, for to that
   429  The multiplying Villanies of Nature
   430  Doe swarme vpon him) from the Westerne Isles
   431  Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,
   432  And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,
   433  Shew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:
   434  For braue Macbeth (well hee deserues that Name)
   435  Disdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,
   436  Which smoak'd with bloody execution
   437  (Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,
   438  Till hee fac'd the Slaue:
   439  Which neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,
   440  Till he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,
   441  And fix'd his Head vpon our Battlements
   442  
   443     King. O valiant Cousin, worthy Gentleman
   444  
   445     Cap. As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,
   446  Shipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:
   447  So from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,
   448  Discomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,
   449  No sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,
   450  Compell'd these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles,
   451  But the Norweyan Lord, surueying vantage,
   452  With furbusht Armes, and new supplyes of men,
   453  Began a fresh assault
   454  
   455     King. Dismay'd not this our Captaines, Macbeth and
   456  Banquoh?
   457    Cap. Yes, as Sparrowes, Eagles;
   458  Or the Hare, the Lyon:
   459  If I say sooth, I must report they were
   460  As Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,
   461  So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:
   462  Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,
   463  Or memorize another Golgotha,
   464  I cannot tell: but I am faint,
   465  My Gashes cry for helpe
   466  
   467     King. So well thy words become thee, as thy wounds,
   468  They smack of Honor both: Goe get him Surgeons.
   469  Enter Rosse and Angus.
   470  
   471  Who comes here?
   472    Mal. The worthy Thane of Rosse
   473  
   474     Lenox. What a haste lookes through his eyes?
   475  So should he looke, that seemes to speake things strange
   476  
   477     Rosse. God saue the King
   478  
   479     King. Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane?
   480    Rosse. From Fiffe, great King,
   481  Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie,
   482  And fanne our people cold.
   483  Norway himselfe, with terrible numbers,
   484  Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor,
   485  The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismall Conflict,
   486  Till that Bellona's Bridegroome, lapt in proofe,
   487  Confronted him with selfe-comparisons,
   488  Point against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,
   489  Curbing his lauish spirit: and to conclude,
   490  The Victorie fell on vs
   491  
   492     King. Great happinesse
   493  
   494     Rosse. That now Sweno, the Norwayes King,
   495  Craues composition:
   496  Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men,
   497  Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes ynch,
   498  Ten thousand Dollars, to our generall vse
   499  
   500     King. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue
   501  Our Bosome interest: Goe pronounce his present death,
   502  And with his former Title greet Macbeth
   503  
   504     Rosse. Ile see it done
   505  
   506     King. What he hath lost, Noble Macbeth hath wonne.
   507  
   508  Exeunt.
   509  
   510  
   511  Scena Tertia.
   512  
   513  Thunder. Enter the three Witches.
   514  
   515    1. Where hast thou beene, Sister?
   516    2. Killing Swine
   517  
   518     3. Sister, where thou?
   519    1. A Saylors Wife had Chestnuts in her Lappe,
   520  And mouncht, & mouncht, and mouncht:
   521  Giue me, quoth I.
   522  Aroynt thee, Witch, the rumpe-fed Ronyon cryes.
   523  Her Husband's to Aleppo gone, Master o'th' Tiger:
   524  But in a Syue Ile thither sayle,
   525  And like a Rat without a tayle,
   526  Ile doe, Ile doe, and Ile doe
   527  
   528     2. Ile giue thee a Winde
   529  
   530     1. Th'art kinde
   531  
   532     3. And I another
   533  
   534     1. I my selfe haue all the other,
   535  And the very Ports they blow,
   536  All the Quarters that they know,
   537  I'th' Ship-mans Card.
   538  Ile dreyne him drie as Hay:
   539  Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day
   540  Hang vpon his Pent-house Lid:
   541  He shall liue a man forbid:
   542  Wearie Seu'nights, nine times nine,
   543  Shall he dwindle, peake, and pine:
   544  Though his Barke cannot be lost,
   545  Yet it shall be Tempest-tost.
   546  Looke what I haue
   547  
   548     2. Shew me, shew me
   549  
   550     1. Here I haue a Pilots Thumbe,
   551  Wrackt, as homeward he did come.
   552  
   553  Drum within.
   554  
   555    3. A Drumme, a Drumme:
   556  Macbeth doth come
   557  
   558     All. The weyward Sisters, hand in hand,
   559  Posters of the Sea and Land,
   560  Thus doe goe, about, about,
   561  Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
   562  And thrice againe, to make vp nine.
   563  Peace, the Charme's wound vp.
   564  Enter Macbeth and Banquo.
   565  
   566    Macb. So foule and faire a day I haue not seene
   567  
   568     Banquo. How farre is't call'd to Soris? What are these,
   569  So wither'd, and so wilde in their attyre,
   570  That looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,
   571  And yet are on't? Liue you, or are you aught
   572  That man may question? you seeme to vnderstand me,
   573  By each at once her choppie finger laying
   574  Vpon her skinnie Lips: you should be Women,
   575  And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete
   576  That you are so
   577  
   578     Mac. Speake if you can: what are you?
   579    1. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Glamis
   580  
   581     2. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Cawdor
   582  
   583     3. All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter
   584  
   585     Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare
   586  Things that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth
   587  Are ye fantasticall, or that indeed
   588  Which outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner
   589  You greet with present Grace, and great prediction
   590  Of Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,
   591  That he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.
   592  If you can looke into the Seedes of Time,
   593  And say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,
   594  Speake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare
   595  Your fauors, nor your hate
   596  
   597     1. Hayle
   598  
   599     2. Hayle
   600  
   601     3. Hayle
   602  
   603     1. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater
   604  
   605     2. Not so happy, yet much happyer
   606  
   607     3. Thou shalt get Kings, though thou be none:
   608  So all haile Macbeth, and Banquo
   609  
   610     1. Banquo, and Macbeth, all haile
   611  
   612     Macb. Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:
   613  By Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,
   614  But how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liues
   615  A prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,
   616  Stands not within the prospect of beleefe,
   617  No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence
   618  You owe this strange Intelligence, or why
   619  Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way
   620  With such Prophetique greeting?
   621  Speake, I charge you.
   622  
   623  Witches vanish.
   624  
   625    Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,
   626  And these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?
   627    Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,
   628  Melted, as breath into the Winde.
   629  Would they had stay'd
   630  
   631     Banq. Were such things here, as we doe speake about?
   632  Or haue we eaten on the insane Root,
   633  That takes the Reason Prisoner?
   634    Macb. Your Children shall be Kings
   635  
   636     Banq. You shall be King
   637  
   638     Macb. And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
   639    Banq. Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?
   640  Enter Rosse and Angus.
   641  
   642    Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,
   643  The newes of thy successe: and when he reades
   644  Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,
   645  His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,
   646  Which should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,
   647  In viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,
   648  He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,
   649  Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make
   650  Strange Images of death, as thick as Tale
   651  Can post with post, and euery one did beare
   652  Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,
   653  And powr'd them downe before him
   654  
   655     Ang. Wee are sent,
   656  To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,
   657  Onely to harrold thee into his sight,
   658  Not pay thee
   659  
   660     Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,
   661  He bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
   662  In which addition, haile most worthy Thane,
   663  For it is thine
   664  
   665     Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?
   666    Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:
   667  Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?
   668    Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,
   669  But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,
   670  Which he deserues to loose.
   671  Whether he was combin'd with those of Norway,
   672  Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,
   673  And vantage; or that with both he labour'd
   674  In his Countreyes wracke, I know not:
   675  But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,
   676  Haue ouerthrowne him
   677  
   678     Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:
   679  The greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.
   680  Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,
   681  When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,
   682  Promis'd no lesse to them
   683  
   684     Banq. That trusted home,
   685  Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,
   686  Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
   687  And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,
   688  The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,
   689  Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's
   690  In deepest consequence.
   691  Cousins, a word, I pray you
   692  
   693     Macb. Two Truths are told,
   694  As happy Prologues to the swelling Act
   695  Of the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:
   696  This supernaturall solliciting
   697  Cannot be ill; cannot be good.
   698  If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,
   699  Commencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
   700  If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,
   701  Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,
   702  And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,
   703  Against the vse of Nature? Present Feares
   704  Are lesse then horrible Imaginings:
   705  My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,
   706  Shakes so my single state of Man,
   707  That Function is smother'd in surmise,
   708  And nothing is, but what is not
   709  
   710     Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt
   711  
   712     Macb. If Chance will haue me King,
   713  Why Chance may Crowne me,
   714  Without my stirre
   715  
   716     Banq. New Honors come vpon him
   717  Like our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,
   718  But with the aid of vse
   719  
   720     Macb. Come what come may,
   721  Time, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day
   722  
   723     Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure
   724  
   725     Macb. Giue me your fauour:
   726  My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.
   727  Kinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,
   728  Where euery day I turne the Leafe,
   729  To reade them.
   730  Let vs toward the King: thinke vpon
   731  What hath chanc'd: and at more time,
   732  The Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake
   733  Our free Hearts each to other
   734  
   735     Banq. Very gladly
   736  
   737     Macb. Till then enough:
   738  Come friends.
   739  
   740  Exeunt.
   741  
   742  
   743  Scena Quarta.
   744  
   745  Flourish. Enter King, Lenox, Malcolme, Donalbaine, and
   746  Attendants.
   747  
   748    King. Is execution done on Cawdor?
   749  Or not those in Commission yet return'd?
   750    Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.
   751  But I haue spoke with one that saw him die:
   752  Who did report, that very frankly hee
   753  Confess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,
   754  And set forth a deepe Repentance:
   755  Nothing in his Life became him,
   756  Like the leauing it. Hee dy'de,
   757  As one that had beene studied in his death,
   758  To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,
   759  As 'twere a carelesse Trifle
   760  
   761     King. There's no Art,
   762  To finde the Mindes construction in the Face.
   763  He was a Gentleman, on whom I built
   764  An absolute Trust.
   765  Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.
   766  
   767  O worthyest Cousin,
   768  The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now
   769  Was heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,
   770  That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,
   771  To ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,
   772  That the proportion both of thanks, and payment,
   773  Might haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,
   774  More is thy due, then more then all can pay
   775  
   776     Macb. The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,
   777  In doing it, payes it selfe.
   778  Your Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:
   779  And our Duties are to your Throne, and State,
   780  Children, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,
   781  By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue
   782  And Honor
   783  
   784     King. Welcome hither:
   785  I haue begun to plant thee, and will labour
   786  To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
   787  That hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowne
   788  No lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,
   789  And hold thee to my Heart
   790  
   791     Banq. There if I grow,
   792  The Haruest is your owne
   793  
   794     King. My plenteous Ioyes,
   795  Wanton in fulnesse, seeke to hide themselues
   796  In drops of sorrow. Sonnes, Kinsmen, Thanes,
   797  And you whose places are the nearest, know,
   798  We will establish our Estate vpon
   799  Our eldest, Malcolme, whom we name hereafter,
   800  The Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must
   801  Not vnaccompanied, inuest him onely,
   802  But signes of Noblenesse, like Starres, shall shine
   803  On all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,
   804  And binde vs further to you
   805  
   806     Macb. The Rest is Labor, which is not vs'd for you:
   807  Ile be my selfe the Herbenger, and make ioyfull
   808  The hearing of my Wife, with your approach:
   809  So humbly take my leaue
   810  
   811     King. My worthy Cawdor
   812  
   813     Macb. The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,
   814  On which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,
   815  For in my way it lyes. Starres hide your fires,
   816  Let not Light see my black and deepe desires:
   817  The Eye winke at the Hand: yet let that bee,
   818  Which the Eye feares, when it is done to see.
   819  Enter.
   820  
   821    King. True worthy Banquo: he is full so valiant,
   822  And in his commendations, I am fed:
   823  It is a Banquet to me. Let's after him,
   824  Whose care is gone before, to bid vs welcome:
   825  It is a peerelesse Kinsman.
   826  
   827  Flourish. Exeunt.
   828  
   829  
   830  Scena Quinta.
   831  
   832  Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter.
   833  
   834    Lady. They met me in the day of successe: and I haue
   835  learn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then
   836  mortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them
   837  further, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.
   838  Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from
   839  the King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title
   840  before, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to
   841  the comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This
   842  haue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of
   843  Greatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing
   844  by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay
   845  it to thy heart and farewell.
   846  Glamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
   847  What thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,
   848  It is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,
   849  To catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,
   850  Art not without Ambition, but without
   851  The illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,
   852  That would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,
   853  And yet would'st wrongly winne.
   854  Thould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,
   855  Thus thou must doe, if thou haue it;
   856  And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,
   857  Then wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,
   858  That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,
   859  And chastise with the valour of my Tongue
   860  All that impeides thee from the Golden Round,
   861  Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme
   862  To haue thee crown'd withall.
   863  Enter Messenger.
   864  
   865  What is your tidings?
   866    Mess. The King comes here to Night
   867  
   868     Lady. Thou'rt mad to say it.
   869  Is not thy Master with him? who, wer't so,
   870  Would haue inform'd for preparation
   871  
   872     Mess. So please you, it is true: our Thane is comming:
   873  One of my fellowes had the speed of him;
   874  Who almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
   875  Then would make vp his Message
   876  
   877     Lady. Giue him tending,
   878  He brings great newes,
   879  
   880  Exit Messenger.
   881  
   882  The Rauen himselfe is hoarse,
   883  That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan
   884  Vnder my Battlements. Come you Spirits,
   885  That tend on mortall thoughts, vnsex me here,
   886  And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe, top-full
   887  Of direst Crueltie: make thick my blood,
   888  Stop vp th' accesse, and passage to Remorse,
   889  That no compunctious visitings of Nature
   890  Shake my fell purpose, nor keepe peace betweene
   891  Th' effect, and hit. Come to my Womans Brests,
   892  And take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,
   893  Where-euer, in your sightlesse substances,
   894  You wait on Natures Mischiefe. Come thick Night,
   895  And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell,
   896  
   897  That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes,
   898  Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke,
   899  To cry, hold, hold.
   900  Enter Macbeth.
   901  
   902  Great Glamys, worthy Cawdor,
   903  Greater then both, by the all-haile hereafter,
   904  Thy Letters haue transported me beyond
   905  This ignorant present, and I feele now
   906  The future in the instant
   907  
   908     Macb. My dearest Loue,
   909  Duncan comes here to Night
   910  
   911     Lady. And when goes hence?
   912    Macb. To morrow, as he purposes
   913  
   914     Lady. O neuer,
   915  Shall Sunne that Morrow see.
   916  Your Face, my Thane, is as a Booke, where men
   917  May reade strange matters, to beguile the time.
   918  Looke like the time, beare welcome in your Eye,
   919  Your Hand, your Tongue: looke like th' innocent flower,
   920  But be the Serpent vnder't. He that's comming,
   921  Must be prouided for: and you shall put
   922  This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch,
   923  Which shall to all our Nights, and Dayes to come,
   924  Giue solely soueraigne sway, and Masterdome
   925  
   926     Macb. We will speake further,
   927    Lady. Onely looke vp cleare:
   928  To alter fauor, euer is to feare:
   929  Leaue all the rest to me.
   930  
   931  Exeunt.
   932  
   933  
   934  Scena Sexta.
   935  
   936  Hoboyes, and Torches. Enter King, Malcolme, Donalbaine,
   937  Banquo, Lenox,
   938  Macduff, Rosse, Angus, and Attendants.
   939  
   940    King. This Castle hath a pleasant seat,
   941  The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe
   942  Vnto our gentle sences
   943  
   944     Banq. This Guest of Summer,
   945  The Temple-haunting Barlet does approue,
   946  By his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath
   947  Smells wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,
   948  Buttrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this Bird
   949  Hath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,
   950  Where they must breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd
   951  The ayre is delicate.
   952  Enter Lady.
   953  
   954    King. See, see our honor'd Hostesse:
   955  The Loue that followes vs, sometime is our trouble,
   956  Which still we thanke as Loue. Herein I teach you,
   957  How you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines,
   958  And thanke vs for your trouble
   959  
   960     Lady. All our seruice,
   961  In euery point twice done, and then done double,
   962  Were poore, and single Businesse, to contend
   963  Against those Honors deepe, and broad,
   964  Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House:
   965  For those of old, and the late Dignities,
   966  Heap'd vp to them, we rest your Ermites
   967  
   968     King. Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
   969  We courst him at the heeles, and had a purpose
   970  To be his Purueyor: But he rides well,
   971  And his great Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him
   972  To his home before vs: Faire and Noble Hostesse
   973  We are your guest to night
   974  
   975     La. Your Seruants euer,
   976  Haue theirs, themselues, and what is theirs in compt,
   977  To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure,
   978  Still to returne your owne
   979  
   980     King. Giue me your hand:
   981  Conduct me to mine Host we loue him highly,
   982  And shall continue, our Graces towards him.
   983  By your leaue Hostesse.
   984  
   985  Exeunt.
   986  
   987  Scena Septima.
   988  
   989  Hoboyes. Torches. Enter a Sewer, and diuers Seruants with Dishes
   990  and
   991  Seruice ouer the Stage. Then enter Macbeth
   992  
   993     Macb. If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,
   994  It were done quickly: If th' Assassination
   995  Could trammell vp the Consequence, and catch
   996  With his surcease, Successe: that but this blow
   997  Might be the be all, and the end all. Heere,
   998  But heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,
   999  Wee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,
  1000  We still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach
  1001  Bloody Instructions, which being taught, returne
  1002  To plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice
  1003  Commends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice
  1004  To our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;
  1005  First, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,
  1006  Strong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,
  1007  Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore,
  1008  Not beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane
  1009  Hath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin
  1010  So cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues
  1011  Will pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against
  1012  The deepe damnation of his taking off:
  1013  And Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,
  1014  Striding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd
  1015  Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,
  1016  Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,
  1017  That teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre
  1018  To pricke the sides of my intent, but onely
  1019  Vaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,
  1020  And falles on th' other.
  1021  Enter Lady.
  1022  
  1023  How now? What Newes?
  1024    La. He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?
  1025    Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?
  1026    La. Know you not, he ha's?
  1027    Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:
  1028  He hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought
  1029  Golden Opinions from all sorts of people,
  1030  Which would be worne now in their newest glosse,
  1031  Not cast aside so soone
  1032  
  1033     La. Was the hope drunke,
  1034  Wherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?
  1035  And wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,
  1036  At what it did so freely? From this time,
  1037  Such I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd
  1038  To be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,
  1039  As thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that
  1040  Which thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,
  1041  And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?
  1042  Letting I dare not, wait vpon I would,
  1043  Like the poore Cat i'th' Addage
  1044  
  1045     Macb. Prythee peace:
  1046  I dare do all that may become a man,
  1047  Who dares do more, is none
  1048  
  1049     La. What Beast was't then
  1050  That made you breake this enterprize to me?
  1051  When you durst do it, then you were a man:
  1052  And to be more then what you were, you would
  1053  Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place
  1054  Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
  1055  They haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now
  1056  Do's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know
  1057  How tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,
  1058  I would, while it was smyling in my Face,
  1059  Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,
  1060  And dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne
  1061  As you haue done to this
  1062  
  1063     Macb. If we should faile?
  1064    Lady. We faile?
  1065  But screw your courage to the sticking place,
  1066  And wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,
  1067  (Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney
  1068  Soundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines
  1069  Will I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,
  1070  That Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,
  1071  Shall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason
  1072  A Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,
  1073  Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,
  1074  What cannot you and I performe vpon
  1075  Th' vnguarded Duncan? What not put vpon
  1076  His spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt
  1077  Of our great quell
  1078  
  1079     Macb. Bring forth Men-Children onely:
  1080  For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose
  1081  Nothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,
  1082  When we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two
  1083  Of his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,
  1084  That they haue don't?
  1085    Lady. Who dares receiue it other,
  1086  As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,
  1087  Vpon his Death?
  1088    Macb. I am settled, and bend vp
  1089  Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.
  1090  Away, and mock the time with fairest show,
  1091  False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know.
  1092  
  1093  Exeunt.
  1094  
  1095  
  1096  Actus Secundus. Scena Prima.
  1097  
  1098  Enter Banquo, and Fleance, with a Torch before him.
  1099  
  1100    Banq. How goes the Night, Boy?
  1101    Fleance. The Moone is downe: I haue not heard the
  1102  Clock
  1103  
  1104     Banq. And she goes downe at Twelue
  1105  
  1106     Fleance. I take't, 'tis later, Sir
  1107  
  1108     Banq. Hold, take my Sword:
  1109  There's Husbandry in Heauen,
  1110  Their Candles are all out: take thee that too.
  1111  A heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me,
  1112  And yet I would not sleepe:
  1113  Mercifull Powers, restraine in me the cursed thoughts
  1114  That Nature giues way to in repose.
  1115  Enter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch.
  1116  
  1117  Giue me my Sword: who's there?
  1118    Macb. A Friend
  1119  
  1120     Banq. What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's a bed.
  1121  He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,
  1122  And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.
  1123  This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,
  1124  By the name of most kind Hostesse,
  1125  And shut vp in measurelesse content
  1126  
  1127     Mac. Being vnprepar'd,
  1128  Our will became the seruant to defect,
  1129  Which else should free haue wrought
  1130  
  1131     Banq. All's well.
  1132  I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:
  1133  To you they haue shew'd some truth
  1134  
  1135     Macb. I thinke not of them:
  1136  Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue,
  1137  We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,
  1138  If you would graunt the time
  1139  
  1140     Banq. At your kind'st leysure
  1141  
  1142     Macb. If you shall cleaue to my consent,
  1143  When 'tis, it shall make Honor for you
  1144  
  1145     Banq. So I lose none,
  1146  In seeking to augment it, but still keepe
  1147  My Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance cleare,
  1148  I shall be counsail'd
  1149  
  1150     Macb. Good repose the while
  1151  
  1152     Banq. Thankes Sir: the like to you.
  1153  
  1154  Exit Banquo.
  1155  
  1156    Macb. Goe bid thy Mistresse, when my drinke is ready,
  1157  She strike vpon the Bell. Get thee to bed.
  1158  Enter.
  1159  
  1160  Is this a Dagger, which I see before me,
  1161  The Handle toward my Hand? Come, let me clutch thee:
  1162  I haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.
  1163  Art thou not fatall Vision, sensible
  1164  To feeling, as to sight? or art thou but
  1165  A Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,
  1166  Proceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?
  1167  I see thee yet, in forme as palpable,
  1168  As this which now I draw.
  1169  Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going,
  1170  And such an Instrument I was to vse.
  1171  Mine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,
  1172  Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
  1173  And on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,
  1174  Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
  1175  It is the bloody Businesse, which informes
  1176  Thus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World
  1177  Nature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse
  1178  The Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates
  1179  Pale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,
  1180  Alarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,
  1181  Whose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
  1182  With Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe
  1183  Moues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth
  1184  Heare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare
  1185  Thy very stones prate of my where-about,
  1186  And take the present horror from the time,
  1187  Which now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:
  1188  Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.
  1189  
  1190  A Bell rings.
  1191  
  1192  I goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.
  1193  Heare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,
  1194  That summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.
  1195  Enter.
  1196  
  1197  
  1198  Scena Secunda.
  1199  
  1200  Enter Lady.
  1201  
  1202    La. That which hath made the[m] drunk, hath made me bold:
  1203  What hath quench'd them, hath giuen me fire.
  1204  Hearke, peace: it was the Owle that shriek'd,
  1205  The fatall Bell-man, which giues the stern'st good-night.
  1206  He is about it, the Doores are open:
  1207  And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge
  1208  With Snores. I haue drugg'd their Possets,
  1209  That Death and Nature doe contend about them,
  1210  Whether they liue, or dye.
  1211  Enter Macbeth.
  1212  
  1213    Macb. Who's there? what hoa?
  1214    Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,
  1215  And 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,
  1216  Confounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,
  1217  He could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled
  1218  My Father as he slept, I had don't.
  1219  My Husband?
  1220    Macb. I haue done the deed:
  1221  Didst thou not heare a noyse?
  1222    Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets cry.
  1223  Did not you speake?
  1224    Macb. When?
  1225    Lady. Now
  1226  
  1227     Macb. As I descended?
  1228    Lady. I
  1229  
  1230     Macb. Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?
  1231    Lady. Donalbaine
  1232  
  1233     Mac. This is a sorry sight
  1234  
  1235     Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight
  1236  
  1237     Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,
  1238  And one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:
  1239  I stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,
  1240  And addrest them againe to sleepe
  1241  
  1242     Lady. There are two lodg'd together
  1243  
  1244     Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,
  1245  As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:
  1246  Listning their feare, I could not say Amen,
  1247  When they did say God blesse vs
  1248  
  1249     Lady. Consider it not so deepely
  1250  
  1251     Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?
  1252  I had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat
  1253  
  1254     Lady. These deeds must not be thought
  1255  After these wayes: so, it will make vs mad
  1256  
  1257     Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:
  1258  Macbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,
  1259  Sleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,
  1260  The death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,
  1261  Balme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,
  1262  Chiefe nourisher in Life's Feast
  1263  
  1264     Lady. What doe you meane?
  1265    Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:
  1266  Glamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor
  1267  Shall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more
  1268  
  1269     Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,
  1270  You doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke
  1271  So braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,
  1272  And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.
  1273  Why did you bring these Daggers from the place?
  1274  They must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare
  1275  The sleepie Groomes with blood
  1276  
  1277     Macb. Ile goe no more:
  1278  I am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:
  1279  Looke on't againe, I dare not
  1280  
  1281     Lady. Infirme of purpose:
  1282  Giue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,
  1283  Are but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,
  1284  That feares a painted Deuill. If he doe bleed,
  1285  Ile guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,
  1286  For it must seeme their Guilt.
  1287  Enter.
  1288  
  1289  Knocke within.
  1290  
  1291    Macb. Whence is that knocking?
  1292  How is't with me, when euery noyse appalls me?
  1293  What Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.
  1294  Will all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood
  1295  Cleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather
  1296  The multitudinous Seas incarnardine,
  1297  Making the Greene one, Red.
  1298  Enter Lady.
  1299  
  1300    Lady. My Hands are of your colour: but I shame
  1301  To weare a Heart so white.
  1302  
  1303  Knocke.
  1304  
  1305  I heare a knocking at the South entry:
  1306  Retyre we to our Chamber:
  1307  A little Water cleares vs of this deed.
  1308  How easie is it then? your Constancie
  1309  Hath left you vnattended.
  1310  
  1311  Knocke.
  1312  
  1313  Hearke, more knocking.
  1314  Get on your Night-Gowne, least occasion call vs,
  1315  And shew vs to be Watchers: be not lost
  1316  So poorely in your thoughts
  1317  
  1318     Macb. To know my deed,
  1319  
  1320  Knocke.
  1321  
  1322  'Twere best not know my selfe.
  1323  Wake Duncan with thy knocking:
  1324  I would thou could'st.
  1325  
  1326  Exeunt.
  1327  
  1328  
  1329  Scena Tertia.
  1330  
  1331  Enter a Porter. Knocking within.
  1332  
  1333    Porter. Here's a knocking indeede: if a man were
  1334  Porter of Hell Gate, hee should haue old turning the
  1335  Key.
  1336  
  1337  Knock.
  1338  
  1339  Knock, Knock, Knock. Who's there
  1340  i'th' name of Belzebub? Here's a Farmer, that hang'd
  1341  himselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue
  1342  Napkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't.
  1343  
  1344  Knock.
  1345  
  1346  Knock, knock. Who's there in th' other Deuils Name?
  1347  Faith here's an Equiuocator, that could sweare in both
  1348  the Scales against eyther Scale, who committed Treason
  1349  enough for Gods sake, yet could not equiuocate to Heauen:
  1350  oh come in, Equiuocator.
  1351  
  1352  Knock.
  1353  
  1354  Knock, Knock, Knock. Who's there? 'Faith here's an English
  1355  Taylor come hither, for stealing out of a French Hose:
  1356  Come in Taylor, here you may rost your Goose.
  1357  Knock.
  1358  
  1359  Knock, Knock. Neuer at quiet: What are you? but this
  1360  place is too cold for Hell. Ile Deuill-Porter it no further:
  1361  I had thought to haue let in some of all Professions, that
  1362  goe the Primrose way to th' euerlasting Bonfire.
  1363  
  1364  Knock.
  1365  
  1366  Anon, anon, I pray you remember the Porter.
  1367  Enter Macduff, and Lenox.
  1368  
  1369    Macd. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to Bed,
  1370  That you doe lye so late?
  1371    Port. Faith Sir, we were carowsing till the second Cock:
  1372  And Drinke, Sir, is a great prouoker of three things
  1373  
  1374     Macd. What three things does Drinke especially
  1375  prouoke?
  1376    Port. Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.
  1377  Lecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes
  1378  the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore
  1379  much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:
  1380  it makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,
  1381  and it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens
  1382  him; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,
  1383  equiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,
  1384  leaues him
  1385  
  1386     Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night
  1387  
  1388     Port. That it did, Sir, i'the very Throat on me: but I
  1389  requited him for his Lye, and (I thinke) being too strong
  1390  for him, though he tooke vp my Legges sometime, yet I
  1391  made a Shift to cast him.
  1392  Enter Macbeth.
  1393  
  1394    Macd. Is thy Master stirring?
  1395  Our knocking ha's awak'd him: here he comes
  1396  
  1397     Lenox. Good morrow, Noble Sir
  1398  
  1399     Macb. Good morrow both
  1400  
  1401     Macd. Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
  1402    Macb. Not yet
  1403  
  1404     Macd. He did command me to call timely on him,
  1405  I haue almost slipt the houre
  1406  
  1407     Macb. Ile bring you to him
  1408  
  1409     Macd. I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you:
  1410  But yet 'tis one
  1411  
  1412     Macb. The labour we delight in, Physicks paine:
  1413  This is the Doore
  1414  
  1415     Macd. Ile make so bold to call, for 'tis my limitted
  1416  seruice.
  1417  
  1418  Exit Macduffe.
  1419  
  1420    Lenox. Goes the King hence to day?
  1421    Macb. He does: he did appoint so
  1422  
  1423     Lenox. The Night ha's been vnruly:
  1424  Where we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,
  1425  And (as they say) lamentings heard i'th' Ayre;
  1426  Strange Schreemes of Death,
  1427  And Prophecying, with Accents terrible,
  1428  Of dyre Combustion, and confus'd Euents,
  1429  New hatch'd toth' wofull time.
  1430  The obscure Bird clamor'd the liue-long Night.
  1431  Some say, the Earth was Feuorous,
  1432  And did shake
  1433  
  1434     Macb. 'Twas a rough Night
  1435  
  1436     Lenox. My young remembrance cannot paralell
  1437  A fellow to it.
  1438  Enter Macduff.
  1439  
  1440    Macd. O horror, horror, horror,
  1441  Tongue nor Heart cannot conceiue, nor name thee
  1442  
  1443     Macb. and Lenox. What's the matter?
  1444    Macd. Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:
  1445  Most sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope
  1446  The Lords anoynted Temple, and stole thence
  1447  The Life o'th' Building
  1448  
  1449     Macb. What is't you say, the Life?
  1450    Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?
  1451    Macd. Approch the Chamber, and destroy your sight
  1452  With a new Gorgon. Doe not bid me speake:
  1453  See, and then speake your selues: awake, awake,
  1454  
  1455  Exeunt. Macbeth and Lenox.
  1456  
  1457  Ring the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,
  1458  Banquo, and Donalbaine: Malcolme awake,
  1459  Shake off this Downey sleepe, Deaths counterfeit,
  1460  And looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see
  1461  The great Doomes Image: Malcolme, Banquo,
  1462  As from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,
  1463  To countenance this horror. Ring the Bell.
  1464  
  1465  Bell rings. Enter Lady.
  1466  
  1467    Lady. What's the Businesse?
  1468  That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley
  1469  The sleepers of the House? speake, speake
  1470  
  1471     Macd. O gentle Lady,
  1472  'Tis not for you to heare what I can speake:
  1473  The repetition in a Womans eare,
  1474  Would murther as it fell.
  1475  Enter Banquo.
  1476  
  1477  O Banquo, Banquo, Our Royall Master's murther'd
  1478  
  1479     Lady. Woe, alas:
  1480  What, in our House?
  1481    Ban. Too cruell, any where.
  1482  Deare Duff, I prythee contradict thy selfe,
  1483  And say, it is not so.
  1484  Enter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse.
  1485  
  1486    Macb. Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,
  1487  I had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,
  1488  There's nothing serious in Mortalitie:
  1489  All is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,
  1490  The Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees
  1491  Is left this Vault, to brag of.
  1492  Enter Malcolme and Donalbaine.
  1493  
  1494    Donal. What is amisse?
  1495    Macb. You are, and doe not know't:
  1496  The Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood
  1497  Is stopt, the very Source of it is stopt
  1498  
  1499     Macd. Your Royall Father's murther'd
  1500  
  1501     Mal. Oh, by whom?
  1502    Lenox. Those of his Chamber, as it seem'd, had don't:
  1503  Their Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,
  1504  So were their Daggers, which vnwip'd, we found
  1505  Vpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,
  1506  No mans Life was to be trusted with them
  1507  
  1508     Macb. O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,
  1509  That I did kill them
  1510  
  1511     Macd. Wherefore did you so?
  1512    Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,
  1513  Loyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:
  1514  Th' expedition of my violent Loue
  1515  Out-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,
  1516  His Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,
  1517  And his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,
  1518  For Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,
  1519  Steep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers
  1520  Vnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,
  1521  That had a heart to loue; and in that heart,
  1522  Courage, to make's loue knowne?
  1523    Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa
  1524  
  1525     Macd. Looke to the Lady
  1526  
  1527     Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,
  1528  That most may clayme this argument for ours?
  1529    Donal. What should be spoken here,
  1530  Where our Fate hid in an augure hole,
  1531  May rush, and seize vs? Let's away,
  1532  Our Teares are not yet brew'd
  1533  
  1534     Mal. Nor our strong Sorrow
  1535  Vpon the foot of Motion
  1536  
  1537     Banq. Looke to the Lady:
  1538  And when we haue our naked Frailties hid,
  1539  That suffer in exposure; let vs meet,
  1540  And question this most bloody piece of worke,
  1541  To know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs:
  1542  In the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,
  1543  Against the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight
  1544  Of Treasonous Mallice
  1545  
  1546     Macd. And so doe I
  1547  
  1548     All. So all
  1549  
  1550     Macb. Let's briefely put on manly readinesse,
  1551  And meet i'th' Hall together
  1552  
  1553     All. Well contented.
  1554  
  1555  Exeunt.
  1556  
  1557    Malc. What will you doe?
  1558  Let's not consort with them:
  1559  To shew an vnfelt Sorrow, is an Office
  1560  Which the false man do's easie.
  1561  Ile to England
  1562  
  1563     Don. To Ireland, I:
  1564  Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer:
  1565  Where we are, there's Daggers in mens smiles;
  1566  The neere in blood, the neerer bloody
  1567  
  1568     Malc. This murtherous Shaft that's shot,
  1569  Hath not yet lighted: and our safest way,
  1570  Is to auoid the ayme. Therefore to Horse,
  1571  And let vs not be daintie of leaue-taking,
  1572  But shift away: there's warrant in that Theft,
  1573  Which steales it selfe, when there's no mercie left.
  1574  
  1575  Exeunt.
  1576  
  1577  
  1578  
  1579  Scena Quarta.
  1580  
  1581  Enter Rosse, with an Old man.
  1582  
  1583    Old man. Threescore and ten I can remember well,
  1584  Within the Volume of which Time, I haue seene
  1585  Houres dreadfull, and things strange: but this sore Night
  1586  Hath trifled former knowings
  1587  
  1588     Rosse. Ha, good Father,
  1589  Thou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,
  1590  Threatens his bloody Stage: byth' Clock 'tis Day,
  1591  And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:
  1592  Is't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,
  1593  That Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,
  1594  When liuing Light should kisse it?
  1595    Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,
  1596  Euen like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,
  1597  A Faulcon towring in her pride of place,
  1598  Was by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd
  1599  
  1600     Rosse. And Duncans Horses,
  1601  (A thing most strange, and certaine)
  1602  Beauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,
  1603  Turn'd wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,
  1604  Contending 'gainst Obedience, as they would
  1605  Make Warre with Mankinde
  1606  
  1607     Old man. 'Tis said, they eate each other
  1608  
  1609     Rosse. They did so:
  1610  To th' amazement of mine eyes that look'd vpon't.
  1611  Enter Macduffe.
  1612  
  1613  Heere comes the good Macduffe.
  1614  How goes the world Sir, now?
  1615    Macd. Why see you not?
  1616    Ross. Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?
  1617    Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine
  1618  
  1619     Ross. Alas the day,
  1620  What good could they pretend?
  1621    Macd. They were subborned,
  1622  Malcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes
  1623  Are stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them
  1624  Suspition of the deed
  1625  
  1626     Rosse. 'Gainst Nature still,
  1627  Thriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp
  1628  Thine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,
  1629  The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth
  1630  
  1631     Macd. He is already nam'd, and gone to Scone
  1632  To be inuested
  1633  
  1634     Rosse. Where is Duncans body?
  1635    Macd. Carried to Colmekill,
  1636  The Sacred Store-house of his Predecessors,
  1637  And Guardian of their Bones
  1638  
  1639     Rosse. Will you to Scone?
  1640    Macd. No Cosin, Ile to Fife
  1641  
  1642     Rosse. Well, I will thither
  1643  
  1644     Macd. Well may you see things wel done there: Adieu
  1645  Least our old Robes sit easier then our new
  1646  
  1647     Rosse. Farewell, Father
  1648  
  1649     Old M. Gods benyson go with you, and with those
  1650  That would make good of bad, and Friends of Foes.
  1651  
  1652  Exeunt. omnes
  1653  
  1654  Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.
  1655  
  1656  Enter Banquo.
  1657  
  1658    Banq. Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
  1659  As the weyard Women promis'd, and I feare
  1660  Thou playd'st most fowly for't: yet it was saide
  1661  It should not stand in thy Posterity,
  1662  But that my selfe should be the Roote, and Father
  1663  Of many Kings. If there come truth from them,
  1664  As vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,
  1665  Why by the verities on thee made good,
  1666  May they not be my Oracles as well,
  1667  And set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.
  1668  
  1669  Senit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords,
  1670  and
  1671  Attendants.
  1672  
  1673    Macb. Heere's our chiefe Guest
  1674  
  1675     La. If he had beene forgotten,
  1676  It had bene as a gap in our great Feast,
  1677  And all-thing vnbecomming
  1678  
  1679     Macb. To night we hold a solemne Supper sir,
  1680  And Ile request your presence
  1681  
  1682     Banq. Let your Highnesse
  1683  Command vpon me, to the which my duties
  1684  Are with a most indissoluble tye
  1685  For euer knit
  1686  
  1687     Macb. Ride you this afternoone?
  1688    Ban. I, my good Lord
  1689  
  1690     Macb. We should haue else desir'd your good aduice
  1691  (Which still hath been both graue, and prosperous)
  1692  In this dayes Councell: but wee'le take to morrow.
  1693  Is't farre you ride?
  1694    Ban. As farre, my Lord, as will fill vp the time
  1695  'Twixt this, and Supper. Goe not my Horse the better,
  1696  I must become a borrower of the Night,
  1697  For a darke houre, or twaine
  1698  
  1699     Macb. Faile not our Feast
  1700  
  1701     Ban. My Lord, I will not
  1702  
  1703     Macb. We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow'd
  1704  In England, and in Ireland, not confessing
  1705  Their cruell Parricide, filling their hearers
  1706  With strange inuention. But of that to morrow,
  1707  When therewithall, we shall haue cause of State,
  1708  Crauing vs ioyntly. Hye you to Horse:
  1709  Adieu, till you returne at Night.
  1710  Goes Fleance with you?
  1711    Ban. I, my good Lord: our time does call vpon's
  1712  
  1713     Macb. I wish your Horses swift, and sure of foot:
  1714  And so I doe commend you to their backs.
  1715  Farwell.
  1716  
  1717  Exit Banquo.
  1718  
  1719  Let euery man be master of his time,
  1720  Till seuen at Night, to make societie
  1721  The sweeter welcome:
  1722  We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone:
  1723  While then, God be with you.
  1724  
  1725  Exeunt. Lords.
  1726  
  1727  Sirrha, a word with you: Attend those men
  1728  Our pleasure?
  1729    Seruant. They are, my Lord, without the Pallace
  1730  Gate
  1731  
  1732     Macb. Bring them before vs.
  1733  
  1734  Exit Seruant.
  1735  
  1736  To be thus, is nothing, but to be safely thus
  1737  Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe,
  1738  And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that
  1739  Which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
  1740  And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,
  1741  He hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,
  1742  To act in safetie. There is none but he,
  1743  Whose being I doe feare: and vnder him,
  1744  My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said
  1745  Mark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,
  1746  When first they put the Name of King vpon me,
  1747  And bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,
  1748  They hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.
  1749  Vpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,
  1750  And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,
  1751  Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,
  1752  No Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,
  1753  For Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,
  1754  For them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,
  1755  Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace
  1756  Onely for them, and mine eternall Iewell
  1757  Giuen to the common Enemie of Man,
  1758  To make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.
  1759  Rather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,
  1760  And champion me to th' vtterance.
  1761  Who's there?
  1762  Enter Seruant, and two Murtherers.
  1763  
  1764  Now goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.
  1765  
  1766  Exit Seruant.
  1767  
  1768  Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
  1769    Murth. It was, so please your Highnesse
  1770  
  1771     Macb. Well then,
  1772  Now haue you consider'd of my speeches:
  1773  Know, that it was he, in the times past,
  1774  Which held you so vnder fortune,
  1775  Which you thought had been our innocent selfe.
  1776  This I made good to you, in our last conference,
  1777  Past in probation with you:
  1778  How you were borne in hand, how crost:
  1779  The Instruments: who wrought with them:
  1780  And all things else, that might
  1781  To halfe a Soule, and to a Notion craz'd,
  1782  Say, Thus did Banquo
  1783  
  1784     1.Murth. You made it knowne to vs
  1785  
  1786     Macb. I did so:
  1787  And went further, which is now
  1788  Our point of second meeting.
  1789  Doe you finde your patience so predominant,
  1790  In your nature, that you can let this goe?
  1791  Are you so Gospell'd, to pray for this good man,
  1792  And for his Issue, whose heauie hand
  1793  Hath bow'd you to the Graue, and begger'd
  1794  Yours for euer?
  1795    1.Murth. We are men, my Liege
  1796  
  1797     Macb. I, in the Catalogue ye goe for men,
  1798  As Hounds, and Greyhounds, Mungrels, Spaniels, Curres,
  1799  Showghes, Water-Rugs, and Demy-Wolues are clipt
  1800  All by the Name of Dogges: the valued file
  1801  Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
  1802  The House-keeper, the Hunter, euery one
  1803  According to the gift, which bounteous Nature
  1804  Hath in him clos'd: whereby he does receiue
  1805  Particular addition, from the Bill,
  1806  That writes them all alike: and so of men.
  1807  Now, if you haue a station in the file,
  1808  Not i'th' worst ranke of Manhood, say't,
  1809  And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes,
  1810  Whose execution takes your Enemie off,
  1811  Grapples you to the heart; and loue of vs,
  1812  Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life,
  1813  Which in his Death were perfect
  1814  
  1815     2.Murth. I am one, my Liege,
  1816  Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World
  1817  Hath so incens'd, that I am recklesse what I doe,
  1818  To spight the World
  1819  
  1820     1.Murth. And I another,
  1821  So wearie with Disasters, tugg'd with Fortune,
  1822  That I would set my Life on any Chance,
  1823  To mend it, or be rid on't
  1824  
  1825     Macb. Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie
  1826  
  1827     Murth. True, my Lord
  1828  
  1829     Macb. So is he mine: and in such bloody distance,
  1830  That euery minute of his being, thrusts
  1831  Against my neer'st of Life: and though I could
  1832  With bare-fac'd power sweepe him from my sight,
  1833  And bid my will auouch it; yet I must not,
  1834  For certaine friends that are both his, and mine,
  1835  Whose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,
  1836  Who I my selfe struck downe: and thence it is,
  1837  That I to your assistance doe make loue,
  1838  Masking the Businesse from the common Eye,
  1839  For sundry weightie Reasons
  1840  
  1841     2.Murth. We shall, my Lord,
  1842  Performe what you command vs
  1843  
  1844     1.Murth. Though our Liues-
  1845    Macb. Your Spirits shine through you.
  1846  Within this houre, at most,
  1847  I will aduise you where to plant your selues,
  1848  Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o'th' time,
  1849  The moment on't, for't must be done to Night,
  1850  And something from the Pallace: alwayes thought,
  1851  That I require a clearenesse; and with him,
  1852  To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke:
  1853    Fleans , his Sonne, that keepes him companie,
  1854  Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me,
  1855  Then is his Fathers, must embrace the fate
  1856  Of that darke houre: resolue your selues apart,
  1857  Ile come to you anon
  1858  
  1859     Murth. We are resolu'd, my Lord
  1860  
  1861     Macb. Ile call vpon you straight: abide within,
  1862  It is concluded: Banquo, thy Soules flight,
  1863  If it finde Heauen, must finde it out to Night.
  1864  
  1865  Exeunt.
  1866  
  1867  
  1868  Scena Secunda.
  1869  
  1870  Enter Macbeths Lady, and a Seruant.
  1871  
  1872    Lady. Is Banquo gone from Court?
  1873    Seruant. I, Madame, but returnes againe to Night
  1874  
  1875     Lady. Say to the King, I would attend his leysure,
  1876  For a few words
  1877  
  1878     Seruant. Madame, I will.
  1879  Enter.
  1880  
  1881    Lady. Nought's had, all's spent.
  1882  Where our desire is got without content:
  1883  'Tis safer, to be that which we destroy,
  1884  Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy.
  1885  Enter Macbeth.
  1886  
  1887  How now, my Lord, why doe you keepe alone?
  1888  Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making,
  1889  Vsing those Thoughts, which should indeed haue dy'd
  1890  With them they thinke on: things without all remedie
  1891  Should be without regard: what's done, is done
  1892  
  1893     Macb. We haue scorch'd the Snake, not kill'd it:
  1894  Shee'le close, and be her selfe, whilest our poore Mallice
  1895  Remaines in danger of her former Tooth.
  1896  But let the frame of things dis-ioynt,
  1897  Both the Worlds suffer,
  1898  Ere we will eate our Meale in feare, and sleepe
  1899  In the affliction of these terrible Dreames,
  1900  That shake vs Nightly: Better be with the dead,
  1901  Whom we, to gayne our peace, haue sent to peace,
  1902  Then on the torture of the Minde to lye
  1903  In restlesse extasie.
  1904  Duncane is in his Graue:
  1905  After Lifes fitfull Feuer, he sleepes well,
  1906  Treason ha's done his worst: nor Steele, nor Poyson,
  1907  Mallice domestique, forraine Leuie, nothing,
  1908  Can touch him further
  1909  
  1910     Lady. Come on:
  1911  Gentle my Lord, sleeke o're your rugged Lookes,
  1912  Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night
  1913  
  1914     Macb. So shall I Loue, and so I pray be you:
  1915  Let your remembrance apply to Banquo,
  1916  Present him Eminence, both with Eye and Tongue:
  1917  Vnsafe the while, that wee must laue
  1918  Our Honors in these flattering streames,
  1919  And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts,
  1920  Disguising what they are
  1921  
  1922     Lady. You must leaue this
  1923  
  1924     Macb. O, full of Scorpions is my Minde, deare Wife:
  1925  Thou know'st, that Banquo and his Fleans liues
  1926  
  1927     Lady. But in them, Natures Coppie's not eterne
  1928  
  1929     Macb. There's comfort yet, they are assaileable,
  1930  Then be thou iocund: ere the Bat hath flowne
  1931  His Cloyster'd flight, ere to black Heccats summons
  1932  The shard-borne Beetle, with his drowsie hums,
  1933  Hath rung Nights yawning Peale,
  1934  There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note
  1935  
  1936     Lady. What's to be done?
  1937    Macb. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest Chuck,
  1938  Till thou applaud the deed: Come, seeling Night,
  1939  Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day,
  1940  And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand
  1941  Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond,
  1942  Which keepes me pale. Light thickens,
  1943  And the Crow makes Wing toth' Rookie Wood:
  1944  Good things of Day begin to droope, and drowse,
  1945  Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey's doe rowse.
  1946  Thou maruell'st at my words: but hold thee still,
  1947  Things bad begun, make strong themselues by ill:
  1948  So prythee goe with me.
  1949  
  1950  Exeunt.
  1951  
  1952  
  1953  Scena Tertia.
  1954  
  1955  Enter three Murtherers.
  1956  
  1957    1. But who did bid thee ioyne with vs?
  1958    3. Macbeth
  1959  
  1960     2. He needes not our mistrust, since he deliuers
  1961  Our Offices, and what we haue to doe,
  1962  To the direction iust
  1963  
  1964     1. Then stand with vs:
  1965  The West yet glimmers with some streakes of Day.
  1966  Now spurres the lated Traueller apace,
  1967  To gayne the timely Inne, and neere approches
  1968  The subiect of our Watch
  1969  
  1970     3. Hearke, I heare Horses
  1971  
  1972     Banquo within. Giue vs a Light there, hoa
  1973  
  1974     2. Then 'tis hee:
  1975  The rest, that are within the note of expectation,
  1976  Alreadie are i'th' Court
  1977  
  1978     1. His Horses goe about
  1979  
  1980     3. Almost a mile: but he does vsually,
  1981  So all men doe, from hence toth' Pallace Gate
  1982  Make it their Walke.
  1983  Enter Banquo and Fleans, with a Torch.
  1984  
  1985    2. A Light, a Light
  1986  
  1987     3. 'Tis hee
  1988  
  1989     1. Stand too't
  1990  
  1991     Ban. It will be Rayne to Night
  1992  
  1993     1. Let it come downe
  1994  
  1995     Ban. O, Trecherie!
  1996  Flye good Fleans, flye, flye, flye,
  1997  Thou may'st reuenge. O Slaue!
  1998    3. Who did strike out the Light?
  1999    1. Was't not the way?
  2000    3. There's but one downe: the Sonne is fled
  2001  
  2002     2. We haue lost
  2003  Best halfe of our Affaire
  2004  
  2005     1. Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
  2006  
  2007  Exeunt.
  2008  
  2009  
  2010  Scaena Quarta.
  2011  
  2012  Banquet prepar'd. Enter Macbeth, Lady, Rosse, Lenox, Lords, and
  2013  Attendants.
  2014  
  2015    Macb. You know your owne degrees, sit downe:
  2016  At first and last, the hearty welcome
  2017  
  2018     Lords. Thankes to your Maiesty
  2019  
  2020     Macb. Our selfe will mingle with Society,
  2021  And play the humble Host:
  2022  Our Hostesse keepes her State, but in best time
  2023  We will require her welcome
  2024  
  2025     La. Pronounce it for me Sir, to all our Friends,
  2026  For my heart speakes, they are welcome.
  2027  Enter first Murtherer.
  2028  
  2029    Macb. See they encounter thee with their harts thanks
  2030  Both sides are euen: heere Ile sit i'th' mid'st,
  2031  Be large in mirth, anon wee'l drinke a Measure
  2032  The Table round. There's blood vpon thy face
  2033  
  2034     Mur. 'Tis Banquo's then
  2035  
  2036     Macb. 'Tis better thee without, then he within.
  2037  Is he dispatch'd?
  2038    Mur. My Lord his throat is cut, that I did for him
  2039  
  2040     Mac. Thou art the best o'th' Cut-throats,
  2041  Yet hee's good that did the like for Fleans:
  2042  If thou did'st it, thou art the Non-pareill
  2043  
  2044     Mur. Most Royall Sir
  2045  Fleans is scap'd
  2046  
  2047     Macb. Then comes my Fit againe:
  2048  I had else beene perfect;
  2049  Whole as the Marble, founded as the Rocke,
  2050  As broad, and generall, as the casing Ayre:
  2051  But now I am cabin'd, crib'd, confin'd, bound in
  2052  To sawcy doubts, and feares. But Banquo's safe?
  2053    Mur. I, my good Lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
  2054  With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
  2055  The least a Death to Nature
  2056  
  2057     Macb. Thankes for that:
  2058  There the growne Serpent lyes, the worme that's fled
  2059  Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed,
  2060  No teeth for th' present. Get thee gone, to morrow
  2061  Wee'l heare our selues againe.
  2062  
  2063  Exit Murderer.
  2064  
  2065    Lady. My Royall Lord,
  2066  You do not giue the Cheere, the Feast is sold
  2067  That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a making:
  2068  'Tis giuen, with welcome: to feede were best at home:
  2069  From thence, the sawce to meate is Ceremony,
  2070  Meeting were bare without it.
  2071  Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeths place.
  2072  
  2073    Macb. Sweet Remembrancer:
  2074  Now good digestion waite on Appetite,
  2075  And health on both
  2076  
  2077     Lenox. May't please your Highnesse sit
  2078  
  2079     Macb. Here had we now our Countries Honor, roof'd,
  2080  Were the grac'd person of our Banquo present:
  2081  Who, may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse,
  2082  Then pitty for Mischance
  2083  
  2084     Rosse. His absence (Sir)
  2085  Layes blame vpon his promise. Pleas't your Highnesse
  2086  To grace vs with your Royall Company?
  2087    Macb. The Table's full
  2088  
  2089     Lenox. Heere is a place reseru'd Sir
  2090  
  2091     Macb. Where?
  2092    Lenox. Heere my good Lord.
  2093  What is't that moues your Highnesse?
  2094    Macb. Which of you haue done this?
  2095    Lords. What, my good Lord?
  2096    Macb. Thou canst not say I did it: neuer shake
  2097  Thy goary lockes at me
  2098  
  2099     Rosse. Gentlemen rise, his Highnesse is not well
  2100  
  2101     Lady. Sit worthy Friends: my Lord is often thus,
  2102  And hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,
  2103  The fit is momentary, vpon a thought
  2104  He will againe be well. If much you note him
  2105  You shall offend him, and extend his Passion,
  2106  Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
  2107    Macb. I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that
  2108  Which might appall the Diuell
  2109  
  2110     La. O proper stuffe:
  2111  This is the very painting of your feare:
  2112  This is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said
  2113  Led you to Duncan. O, these flawes and starts
  2114  (Impostors to true feare) would well become
  2115  A womans story, at a Winters fire
  2116  Authoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe,
  2117  Why do you make such faces? When all's done
  2118  You looke but on a stoole
  2119  
  2120     Macb. Prythee see there:
  2121  Behold, looke, loe, how say you:
  2122  Why what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.
  2123  If Charnell houses, and our Graues must send
  2124  Those that we bury, backe; our Monuments
  2125  Shall be the Mawes of Kytes
  2126  
  2127     La. What? quite vnmann'd in folly
  2128  
  2129     Macb. If I stand heere, I saw him
  2130  
  2131     La. Fie for shame
  2132  
  2133     Macb. Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time
  2134  Ere humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:
  2135  I, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd
  2136  Too terrible for the eare. The times has bene,
  2137  That when the Braines were out, the man would dye,
  2138  And there an end: But now they rise againe
  2139  With twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,
  2140  And push vs from our stooles. This is more strange
  2141  Then such a murther is
  2142  
  2143     La. My worthy Lord
  2144  Your Noble Friends do lacke you
  2145  
  2146     Macb. I do forget:
  2147  Do not muse at me my most worthy Friends,
  2148  I haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing
  2149  To those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,
  2150  Then Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:
  2151  Enter Ghost.
  2152  
  2153  I drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,
  2154  And to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:
  2155  Would he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,
  2156  And all to all
  2157  
  2158     Lords. Our duties, and the pledge
  2159  
  2160     Mac. Auant, & quit my sight, let the earth hide thee:
  2161  Thy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold:
  2162  Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
  2163  Which thou dost glare with
  2164  
  2165     La. Thinke of this good Peeres
  2166  But as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,
  2167  Onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time
  2168  
  2169     Macb. What man dare, I dare:
  2170  Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,
  2171  The arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,
  2172  Take any shape but that, and my firme Nerues
  2173  Shall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,
  2174  And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:
  2175  If trembling I inhabit then, protest mee
  2176  The Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,
  2177  Vnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone
  2178  I am a man againe: pray you sit still
  2179  
  2180     La. You haue displac'd the mirth,
  2181  Broke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder
  2182  
  2183     Macb. Can such things be,
  2184  And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,
  2185  Without our speciall wonder? You make me strange
  2186  Euen to the disposition that I owe,
  2187  When now I thinke you can behold such sights,
  2188  And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,
  2189  When mine is blanch'd with feare
  2190  
  2191     Rosse. What sights, my Lord?
  2192    La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse
  2193  Question enrages him: at once, goodnight.
  2194  Stand not vpon the order of your going,
  2195  But go at once
  2196  
  2197     Len. Good night, and better health
  2198  Attend his Maiesty
  2199  
  2200     La. A kinde goodnight to all.
  2201  
  2202  Exit Lords.
  2203  
  2204    Macb. It will haue blood they say:
  2205  Blood will haue Blood:
  2206  Stones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake:
  2207  Augures, and vnderstood Relations, haue
  2208  By Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth
  2209  The secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?
  2210    La. Almost at oddes with morning, which is which
  2211  
  2212     Macb. How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person
  2213  At our great bidding
  2214  
  2215     La. Did you send to him Sir?
  2216    Macb. I heare it by the way: But I will send:
  2217  There's not a one of them but in his house
  2218  I keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow
  2219  (And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.
  2220  More shall they speake: for now I am bent to know
  2221  By the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,
  2222  All causes shall giue way. I am in blood
  2223  Stept in so farre, that should I wade no more,
  2224  Returning were as tedious as go ore:
  2225  Strange things I haue in head, that will to hand,
  2226  Which must be acted, ere they may be scand
  2227  
  2228     La. You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe
  2229  
  2230     Macb. Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange & self-abuse
  2231  Is the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:
  2232  We are yet but yong indeed.
  2233  
  2234  Exeunt.
  2235  
  2236  
  2237  Scena Quinta.
  2238  
  2239  Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecat.
  2240  
  2241    1. Why how now Hecat, you looke angerly?
  2242    Hec. Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?
  2243  Sawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare
  2244  To Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,
  2245  In Riddles, and Affaires of death;
  2246  And I the Mistris of your Charmes,
  2247  The close contriuer of all harmes,
  2248  Was neuer call'd to beare my part,
  2249  Or shew the glory of our Art?
  2250  And which is worse, all you haue done
  2251  Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne,
  2252  Spightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)
  2253  Loues for his owne ends, not for you.
  2254  But make amends now: Get you gon,
  2255  And at the pit of Acheron
  2256  Meete me i'th' Morning: thither he
  2257  Will come, to know his Destinie.
  2258  Your Vessels, and your Spels prouide,
  2259  Your Charmes, and euery thing beside;
  2260  I am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend
  2261  Vnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.
  2262  Great businesse must be wrought ere Noone.
  2263  Vpon the Corner of the Moone
  2264  There hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,
  2265  Ile catch it ere it come to ground;
  2266  And that distill'd by Magicke slights,
  2267  Shall raise such Artificiall Sprights,
  2268  As by the strength of their illusion,
  2269  Shall draw him on to his Confusion.
  2270  He shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare
  2271  His hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:
  2272  And you all know, Security
  2273  Is Mortals cheefest Enemie.
  2274  
  2275  Musicke, and a Song.
  2276  
  2277  Hearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see
  2278  Sits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.
  2279  
  2280  Sing within. Come away, come away, &c.
  2281  
  2282    1 Come, let's make hast, shee'l soone be
  2283  Backe againe.
  2284  
  2285  Exeunt.
  2286  
  2287  
  2288  Scaena Sexta.
  2289  
  2290  Enter Lenox, and another Lord.
  2291  
  2292    Lenox. My former Speeches,
  2293  Haue but hit your Thoughts
  2294  Which can interpret farther: Onely I say
  2295  Things haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
  2296  Was pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:
  2297  And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
  2298  Whom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,
  2299  For Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.
  2300  Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
  2301  It was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane
  2302  To kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,
  2303  How it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight
  2304  In pious rage, the two delinquents teare,
  2305  That were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?
  2306  Was not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:
  2307  For 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue
  2308  To heare the men deny't. So that I say,
  2309  He ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,
  2310  That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,
  2311  (As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde
  2312  What 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.
  2313  But peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd
  2314  His presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare
  2315  Macduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
  2316  Where he bestowes himselfe?
  2317    Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane
  2318  (From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)
  2319  Liues in the English Court, and is receyu'd
  2320  Of the most Pious Edward, with such grace,
  2321  That the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing
  2322  Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe
  2323  Is gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd
  2324  To wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,
  2325  That by the helpe of these (with him aboue)
  2326  To ratifie the Worke) we may againe
  2327  Giue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:
  2328  Free from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;
  2329  Do faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,
  2330  All which we pine for now. And this report
  2331  Hath so exasperate their King, that hee
  2332  Prepares for some attempt of Warre
  2333  
  2334     Len. Sent he to Macduffe?
  2335    Lord. He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I
  2336  The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,
  2337  And hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time
  2338  That clogges me with this Answer
  2339  
  2340     Lenox. And that well might
  2341  Aduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance
  2342  His wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell
  2343  Flye to the Court of England, and vnfold
  2344  His Message ere he come, that a swift blessing
  2345  May soone returne to this our suffering Country,
  2346  Vnder a hand accurs'd
  2347  
  2348     Lord. Ile send my Prayers with him.
  2349  
  2350  Exeunt.
  2351  
  2352  Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.
  2353  
  2354  Thunder. Enter the three Witches.
  2355  
  2356    1 Thrice the brinded Cat hath mew'd
  2357  
  2358     2 Thrice, and once the Hedge-Pigge whin'd
  2359  
  2360     3 Harpier cries, 'tis time, 'tis time
  2361  
  2362     1 Round about the Caldron go:
  2363  In the poysond Entrailes throw
  2364  Toad, that vnder cold stone,
  2365  Dayes and Nights, ha's thirty one:
  2366  Sweltred Venom sleeping got,
  2367  Boyle thou first i'th' charmed pot
  2368  
  2369     All. Double, double, toile and trouble;
  2370  Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
  2371  
  2372     2 Fillet of a Fenny Snake,
  2373  In the Cauldron boyle and bake:
  2374  Eye of Newt, and Toe of Frogge,
  2375  Wooll of Bat, and Tongue of Dogge:
  2376  Adders Forke, and Blinde-wormes Sting,
  2377  Lizards legge, and Howlets wing:
  2378  For a Charme of powrefull trouble,
  2379  Like a Hell-broth, boyle and bubble
  2380  
  2381     All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,
  2382  Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
  2383  
  2384     3 Scale of Dragon, Tooth of Wolfe,
  2385  Witches Mummey, Maw, and Gulfe
  2386  Of the rauin'd salt Sea sharke:
  2387  Roote of Hemlocke, digg'd i'th' darke:
  2388  Liuer of Blaspheming Iew,
  2389  Gall of Goate, and Slippes of Yew,
  2390  Sliuer'd in the Moones Ecclipse:
  2391  Nose of Turke, and Tartars lips:
  2392  Finger of Birth-strangled Babe,
  2393  Ditch-deliuer'd by a Drab,
  2394  Make the Grewell thicke, and slab.
  2395  Adde thereto a Tigers Chawdron,
  2396  For th' Ingredience of our Cawdron
  2397  
  2398     All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,
  2399  Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
  2400  
  2401     2 Coole it with a Baboones blood,
  2402  Then the Charme is firme and good.
  2403  Enter Hecat, and the other three Witches.
  2404  
  2405    Hec. O well done: I commend your paines,
  2406  And euery one shall share i'th' gaines:
  2407  And now about the Cauldron sing
  2408  Like Elues and Fairies in a Ring,
  2409  Inchanting all that you put in.
  2410  
  2411  Musicke and a Song. Blacke Spirits, &c.
  2412  
  2413    2 By the pricking of my Thumbes,
  2414  Something wicked this way comes:
  2415  Open Lockes, who euer knockes.
  2416  Enter Macbeth.
  2417  
  2418    Macb. How now you secret, black, & midnight Hags?
  2419  What is't you do?
  2420    All. A deed without a name
  2421  
  2422     Macb. I coniure you, by that which you Professe,
  2423  (How ere you come to know it) answer me:
  2424  Though you vntye the Windes, and let them fight
  2425  Against the Churches: Though the yesty Waues
  2426  Confound and swallow Nauigation vp:
  2427  Though bladed Corne be lodg'd, & Trees blown downe,
  2428  Though Castles topple on their Warders heads:
  2429  Though Pallaces, and Pyramids do slope
  2430  Their heads to their Foundations: Though the treasure
  2431  Of Natures Germaine, tumble altogether,
  2432  Euen till destruction sicken: Answer me
  2433  To what I aske you
  2434  
  2435     1 Speake
  2436  
  2437     2 Demand
  2438  
  2439     3 Wee'l answer
  2440  
  2441     1 Say, if th'hadst rather heare it from our mouthes,
  2442  Or from our Masters
  2443  
  2444     Macb. Call 'em: let me see 'em
  2445  
  2446     1 Powre in Sowes blood, that hath eaten
  2447  Her nine Farrow: Greaze that's sweaten
  2448  From the Murderers Gibbet, throw
  2449  Into the Flame
  2450  
  2451     All. Come high or low:
  2452  Thy Selfe and Office deaftly show.
  2453  Thunder. 1. Apparation, an Armed Head.
  2454  
  2455    Macb. Tell me, thou vnknowne power
  2456  
  2457     1 He knowes thy thought:
  2458  Heare his speech, but say thou nought
  2459  
  2460     1 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth:
  2461  Beware Macduffe,
  2462  Beware the Thane of Fife: dismisse me. Enough.
  2463  
  2464  He Descends.
  2465  
  2466    Macb. What ere thou art, for thy good caution, thanks
  2467  Thou hast harp'd my feare aright. But one word more
  2468  
  2469     1 He will not be commanded: heere's another
  2470  More potent then the first.
  2471  
  2472  Thunder. 2 Apparition, a Bloody Childe.
  2473  
  2474    2 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth
  2475  
  2476     Macb. Had I three eares, Il'd heare thee
  2477  
  2478     Appar. Be bloody, bold, & resolute:
  2479  Laugh to scorne
  2480  The powre of man: For none of woman borne
  2481  Shall harme Macbeth.
  2482  
  2483  Descends.
  2484  
  2485    Mac. Then liue Macduffe: what need I feare of thee?
  2486  But yet Ile make assurance: double sure,
  2487  And take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,
  2488  That I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;
  2489  And sleepe in spight of Thunder.
  2490  
  2491  Thunder 3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.
  2492  
  2493  What is this, that rises like the issue of a King,
  2494  And weares vpon his Baby-brow, the round
  2495  And top of Soueraignty?
  2496    All. Listen, but speake not too't
  2497  
  2498     3 Appar. Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:
  2499  Who chafes, who frets, or where Conspirers are:
  2500  Macbeth shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill
  2501  Great Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill
  2502  Shall come against him.
  2503  
  2504  Descend.
  2505  
  2506    Macb. That will neuer bee:
  2507  Who can impresse the Forrest, bid the Tree
  2508  Vnfixe his earth-bound Root? Sweet boadments, good:
  2509  Rebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood
  2510  Of Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth
  2511  Shall liue the Lease of Nature, pay his breath
  2512  To time, and mortall Custome. Yet my Hart
  2513  Throbs to know one thing: Tell me, if your Art
  2514  Can tell so much: Shall Banquo's issue euer
  2515  Reigne in this Kingdome?
  2516    All. Seeke to know no more
  2517  
  2518     Macb. I will be satisfied. Deny me this,
  2519  And an eternall Curse fall on you: Let me know.
  2520  Why sinkes that Caldron? & what noise is this?
  2521  
  2522  Hoboyes
  2523  
  2524    1 Shew
  2525  
  2526     2 Shew
  2527  
  2528     3 Shew
  2529  
  2530     All. Shew his Eyes, and greeue his Hart,
  2531  Come like shadowes, so depart.
  2532  
  2533  A shew of eight Kings, and Banquo last, with a glasse in his hand.
  2534  
  2535    Macb. Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:
  2536  Thy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire
  2537  Thou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:
  2538  A third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,
  2539  Why do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!
  2540  What will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?
  2541  Another yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:
  2542  And yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,
  2543  Which shewes me many more: and some I see,
  2544  That two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.
  2545  Horrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,
  2546  For the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles vpon me,
  2547  And points at them for his. What? is this so?
  2548    1 I Sir, all this is so. But why
  2549  Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
  2550  Come Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,
  2551  And shew the best of our delights.
  2552  Ile Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,
  2553  While you performe your Antique round:
  2554  That this great King may kindly say,
  2555  Our duties, did his welcome pay.
  2556  
  2557  Musicke. The Witches Dance, and vanish.
  2558  
  2559    Macb. Where are they? Gone?
  2560  Let this pernitious houre,
  2561  Stand aye accursed in the Kalender.
  2562  Come in, without there.
  2563  Enter Lenox.
  2564  
  2565    Lenox. What's your Graces will
  2566  
  2567     Macb. Saw you the Weyard Sisters?
  2568    Lenox. No my Lord
  2569  
  2570     Macb. Came they not by you?
  2571    Lenox. No indeed my Lord
  2572  
  2573     Macb. Infected be the Ayre whereon they ride,
  2574  And damn'd all those that trust them. I did heare
  2575  The gallopping of Horse. Who was't came by?
  2576    Len. 'Tis two or three my Lord, that bring you word:
  2577  Macduff is fled to England
  2578  
  2579     Macb. Fled to England?
  2580    Len. I, my good Lord
  2581  
  2582     Macb. Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits:
  2583  The flighty purpose neuer is o're-tooke
  2584  Vnlesse the deed go with it. From this moment,
  2585  The very firstlings of my heart shall be
  2586  The firstlings of my hand. And euen now
  2587  To Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:
  2588  The Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.
  2589  Seize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword
  2590  His Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules
  2591  That trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,
  2592  This deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,
  2593  But no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?
  2594  Come bring me where they are.
  2595  
  2596  Exeunt.
  2597  
  2598  Scena Secunda.
  2599  
  2600  Enter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.
  2601  
  2602    Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?
  2603    Rosse. You must haue patience Madam
  2604  
  2605     Wife. He had none:
  2606  His flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,
  2607  Our feares do make vs Traitors
  2608  
  2609     Rosse. You know not
  2610  Whether it was his wisedome, or his feare
  2611  
  2612     Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,
  2613  His Mansion, and his Titles, in a place
  2614  From whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,
  2615  He wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren
  2616  (The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,
  2617  Her yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:
  2618  All is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;
  2619  As little is the Wisedome, where the flight
  2620  So runnes against all reason
  2621  
  2622     Rosse. My deerest Cooz,
  2623  I pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,
  2624  He is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes
  2625  The fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,
  2626  But cruell are the times, when we are Traitors
  2627  And do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor
  2628  From what we feare, yet know not what we feare,
  2629  But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea
  2630  Each way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:
  2631  Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe:
  2632  Things at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,
  2633  To what they were before. My pretty Cosine,
  2634  Blessing vpon you
  2635  
  2636     Wife. Father'd he is,
  2637  And yet hee's Father-lesse
  2638  
  2639     Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay longer
  2640  It would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.
  2641  I take my leaue at once.
  2642  
  2643  Exit Rosse.
  2644  
  2645    Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,
  2646  And what will you do now? How will you liue?
  2647    Son. As Birds do Mother
  2648  
  2649     Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?
  2650    Son. With what I get I meane, and so do they
  2651  
  2652     Wife. Poore Bird,
  2653  Thou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,
  2654  The Pitfall, nor the Gin
  2655  
  2656     Son. Why should I Mother?
  2657  Poore Birds they are not set for:
  2658  My Father is not dead for all your saying
  2659  
  2660     Wife. Yes, he is dead:
  2661  How wilt thou do for a Father?
  2662    Son. Nay how will you do for a Husband?
  2663    Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market
  2664  
  2665     Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe
  2666  
  2667     Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,
  2668  And yet I'faith with wit enough for thee
  2669  
  2670     Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?
  2671    Wife. I, that he was
  2672  
  2673     Son. What is a Traitor?
  2674    Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes
  2675  
  2676     Son. And be all Traitors, that do so
  2677  
  2678     Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,
  2679  And must be hang'd
  2680  
  2681     Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?
  2682    Wife. Euery one
  2683  
  2684     Son. Who must hang them?
  2685    Wife. Why, the honest men
  2686  
  2687     Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there
  2688  are Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,
  2689  and hang vp them
  2690  
  2691     Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:
  2692  But how wilt thou do for a Father?
  2693    Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you
  2694  would not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely
  2695  haue a new Father
  2696  
  2697     Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?
  2698  Enter a Messenger.
  2699  
  2700    Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,
  2701  Though in your state of Honor I am perfect;
  2702  I doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.
  2703  If you will take a homely mans aduice,
  2704  Be not found heere: Hence with your little ones
  2705  To fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:
  2706  To do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,
  2707  Which is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,
  2708  I dare abide no longer.
  2709  
  2710  Exit Messenger
  2711  
  2712    Wife. Whether should I flye?
  2713  I haue done no harme. But I remember now
  2714  I am in this earthly world: where to do harme
  2715  Is often laudable, to do good sometime
  2716  Accounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)
  2717  Do I put vp that womanly defence,
  2718  To say I haue done no harme?
  2719  What are these faces?
  2720  Enter Murtherers.
  2721  
  2722    Mur. Where is your Husband?
  2723    Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,
  2724  Where such as thou may'st finde him
  2725  
  2726     Mur. He's a Traitor
  2727  
  2728     Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine
  2729  
  2730     Mur. What you Egge?
  2731  Yong fry of Treachery?
  2732    Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,
  2733  Run away I pray you.
  2734  
  2735  Exit crying Murther.
  2736  
  2737  
  2738  Scaena Tertia.
  2739  
  2740  Enter Malcolme and Macduffe.
  2741  
  2742    Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there
  2743  Weepe our sad bosomes empty
  2744  
  2745     Macd. Let vs rather
  2746  Hold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,
  2747  Bestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,
  2748  New Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes
  2749  Strike heauen on the face, that it resounds
  2750  As if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out
  2751  Like Syllable of Dolour
  2752  
  2753     Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;
  2754  What know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,
  2755  As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.
  2756  What you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.
  2757  This Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
  2758  Was once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,
  2759  He hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something
  2760  You may discerne of him through me, and wisedome
  2761  To offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe
  2762  T' appease an angry God
  2763  
  2764     Macd. I am not treacherous
  2765  
  2766     Malc. But Macbeth is.
  2767  A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle
  2768  In an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:
  2769  That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;
  2770  Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
  2771  Though all things foule, would wear the brows of grace
  2772  Yet Grace must still looke so
  2773  
  2774     Macd. I haue lost my Hopes
  2775  
  2776     Malc. Perchance euen there
  2777  Where I did finde my doubts.
  2778  Why in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?
  2779  Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,
  2780  Without leaue-taking. I pray you,
  2781  Let not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,
  2782  But mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,
  2783  What euer I shall thinke
  2784  
  2785     Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,
  2786  Great Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,
  2787  For goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,
  2788  The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,
  2789  I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,
  2790  For the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,
  2791  And the rich East to boot
  2792  
  2793     Mal. Be not offended:
  2794  I speake not as in absolute feare of you:
  2795  I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,
  2796  It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
  2797  Is added to her wounds. I thinke withall,
  2798  There would be hands vplifted in my right:
  2799  And heere from gracious England haue I offer
  2800  Of goodly thousands. But for all this,
  2801  When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,
  2802  Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country
  2803  Shall haue more vices then it had before,
  2804  More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,
  2805  By him that shall succeede
  2806  
  2807     Macd. What should he be?
  2808    Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know
  2809  All the particulars of Vice so grafted,
  2810  That when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth
  2811  Will seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State
  2812  Esteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd
  2813  With my confinelesse harmes
  2814  
  2815     Macd. Not in the Legions
  2816  Of horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd
  2817  In euils, to top Macbeth
  2818  
  2819     Mal. I grant him Bloody,
  2820  Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,
  2821  Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne
  2822  That ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none
  2823  In my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,
  2824  Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp
  2825  The Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire
  2826  All continent Impediments would ore-beare
  2827  That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,
  2828  Then such an one to reigne
  2829  
  2830     Macd. Boundlesse intemperance
  2831  In Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene
  2832  Th' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,
  2833  And fall of many Kings. But feare not yet
  2834  To take vpon you what is yours: you may
  2835  Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
  2836  And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:
  2837  We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be
  2838  That Vulture in you, to deuoure so many
  2839  As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,
  2840  Finding it so inclinde
  2841  
  2842     Mal. With this, there growes
  2843  In my most ill-composd Affection, such
  2844  A stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,
  2845  I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,
  2846  Desire his Iewels, and this others House,
  2847  And my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce
  2848  To make me hunger more, that I should forge
  2849  Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,
  2850  Destroying them for wealth
  2851  
  2852     Macd. This Auarice
  2853  stickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote
  2854  Then Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin
  2855  The Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,
  2856  Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will
  2857  Of your meere Owne. All these are portable,
  2858  With other Graces weigh'd
  2859  
  2860     Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,
  2861  As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,
  2862  Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,
  2863  Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,
  2864  I haue no rellish of them, but abound
  2865  In the diuision of each seuerall Crime,
  2866  Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should
  2867  Poure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,
  2868  Vprore the vniuersall peace, confound
  2869  All vnity on earth
  2870  
  2871     Macd. O Scotland, Scotland
  2872  
  2873     Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:
  2874  I am as I haue spoken
  2875  
  2876     Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!
  2877  With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,
  2878  When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?
  2879  Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne
  2880  By his owne Interdiction stands accust,
  2881  And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father
  2882  Was a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,
  2883  Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,
  2884  Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,
  2885  These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,
  2886  Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,
  2887  Thy hope ends heere
  2888  
  2889     Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion
  2890  Childe of integrity, hath from my soule
  2891  Wip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts
  2892  To thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,
  2893  By many of these traines, hath sought to win me
  2894  Into his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me
  2895  From ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue
  2896  Deale betweene thee and me; For euen now
  2897  I put my selfe to thy Direction, and
  2898  Vnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure
  2899  The taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,
  2900  For strangers to my Nature. I am yet
  2901  Vnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,
  2902  Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.
  2903  At no time broke my Faith, would not betray
  2904  The Deuill to his Fellow, and delight
  2905  No lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking
  2906  Was this vpon my selfe. What I am truly
  2907  Is thine, and my poore Countries to command:
  2908  Whither indeed, before they heere approach
  2909  Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men
  2910  Already at a point, was setting foorth:
  2911  Now wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse
  2912  Be like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?
  2913    Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once
  2914  'Tis hard to reconcile.
  2915  Enter a Doctor.
  2916  
  2917    Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth
  2918  I pray you?
  2919    Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules
  2920  That stay his Cure: their malady conuinces
  2921  The great assay of Art. But at his touch,
  2922  Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,
  2923  They presently amend.
  2924  Enter.
  2925  
  2926    Mal. I thanke you Doctor
  2927  
  2928     Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?
  2929    Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.
  2930  A most myraculous worke in this good King,
  2931  Which often since my heere remaine in England,
  2932  I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen
  2933  Himselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people
  2934  All swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,
  2935  The meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,
  2936  Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes,
  2937  Put on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken
  2938  To the succeeding Royalty he leaues
  2939  The healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,
  2940  He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,
  2941  And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,
  2942  That speake him full of Grace.
  2943  Enter Rosse.
  2944  
  2945    Macd. See who comes heere
  2946  
  2947     Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not
  2948  
  2949     Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither
  2950  
  2951     Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue
  2952  The meanes that makes vs Strangers
  2953  
  2954     Rosse. Sir, Amen
  2955  
  2956     Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?
  2957    Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,
  2958  Almost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot
  2959  Be call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing
  2960  But who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:
  2961  Where sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre
  2962  Are made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes
  2963  A Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,
  2964  Is there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues
  2965  Expire before the Flowers in their Caps,
  2966  Dying, or ere they sicken
  2967  
  2968     Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true
  2969  
  2970     Malc. What's the newest griefe?
  2971    Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,
  2972  Each minute teemes a new one
  2973  
  2974     Macd. How do's my Wife?
  2975    Rosse. Why well
  2976  
  2977     Macd. And all my Children?
  2978    Rosse. Well too
  2979  
  2980     Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?
  2981    Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em
  2982    Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?
  2983    Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings
  2984  Which I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour
  2985  Of many worthy Fellowes, that were out,
  2986  Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,
  2987  For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.
  2988  Now is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland
  2989  Would create Soldiours, make our women fight,
  2990  To doffe their dire distresses
  2991  
  2992     Malc. Bee't their comfort
  2993  We are comming thither: Gracious England hath
  2994  Lent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,
  2995  An older, and a better Souldier, none
  2996  That Christendome giues out
  2997  
  2998     Rosse. Would I could answer
  2999  This comfort with the like. But I haue words
  3000  That would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,
  3001  Where hearing should not latch them
  3002  
  3003     Macd. What concerne they,
  3004  The generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe
  3005  Due to some single brest?
  3006    Rosse. No minde that's honest
  3007  But in it shares some woe, though the maine part
  3008  Pertaines to you alone
  3009  
  3010     Macd. If it be mine
  3011  Keepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it
  3012  
  3013     Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,
  3014  Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound
  3015  that euer yet they heard
  3016  
  3017     Macd. Humh: I guesse at it
  3018  
  3019     Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes
  3020  Sauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner
  3021  Were on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere
  3022  To adde the death of you
  3023  
  3024     Malc. Mercifull Heauen:
  3025  What man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:
  3026  Giue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,
  3027  Whispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake
  3028  
  3029     Macd. My Children too?
  3030    Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found
  3031  
  3032     Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?
  3033    Rosse. I haue said
  3034  
  3035     Malc. Be comforted.
  3036  Let's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,
  3037  To cure this deadly greefe
  3038  
  3039     Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?
  3040  Did you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?
  3041  What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme
  3042  At one fell swoope?
  3043    Malc. Dispute it like a man
  3044  
  3045     Macd. I shall do so:
  3046  But I must also feele it as a man;
  3047  I cannot but remember such things were
  3048  That were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,
  3049  And would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,
  3050  They were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,
  3051  Not for their owne demerits, but for mine
  3052  Fell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now
  3053  
  3054     Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe
  3055  Conuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it
  3056  
  3057     Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,
  3058  And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,
  3059  Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,
  3060  Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe
  3061  Within my Swords length set him, if he scape
  3062  Heauen forgiue him too
  3063  
  3064     Mal. This time goes manly:
  3065  Come go we to the King, our Power is ready,
  3066  Our lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth
  3067  Is ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue
  3068  Put on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,
  3069  The Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.
  3070  
  3071  Exeunt.
  3072  
  3073  Actus Quintus. Scena Prima.
  3074  
  3075  Enter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.
  3076  
  3077    Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can
  3078  perceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last
  3079  walk'd?
  3080    Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue
  3081  seene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon
  3082  her, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,
  3083  write vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne
  3084  to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe
  3085  
  3086     Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at
  3087  once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.
  3088  In this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other
  3089  actuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard
  3090  her say?
  3091    Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her
  3092  
  3093     Doct. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should
  3094  
  3095     Gent. Neither to you, nor any one, hauing no witnesse
  3096  to confirme my speech.
  3097  Enter Lady, with a Taper.
  3098  
  3099  Lo you, heere she comes: This is her very guise, and vpon
  3100  my life fast asleepe: obserue her, stand close
  3101  
  3102     Doct. How came she by that light?
  3103    Gent. Why it stood by her: she ha's light by her continually,
  3104  'tis her command
  3105  
  3106     Doct. You see her eyes are open
  3107  
  3108     Gent. I, but their sense are shut
  3109  
  3110     Doct. What is it she do's now?
  3111  Looke how she rubbes her hands
  3112  
  3113     Gent. It is an accustom'd action with her, to seeme
  3114  thus washing her hands: I haue knowne her continue in
  3115  this a quarter of an houre
  3116  
  3117     Lad. Yet heere's a spot
  3118  
  3119     Doct. Heark, she speaks, I will set downe what comes
  3120  from her, to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly
  3121  
  3122     La. Out damned spot: out I say. One: Two: Why
  3123  then 'tis time to doo't: Hell is murky. Fye, my Lord, fie,
  3124  a Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes
  3125  it, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who
  3126  would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much
  3127  blood in him
  3128  
  3129     Doct. Do you marke that?
  3130    Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?
  3131  What will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that
  3132  my Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this starting
  3133  
  3134     Doct. Go too, go too:
  3135  You haue knowne what you should not
  3136  
  3137     Gent. She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure
  3138  of that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne
  3139  
  3140     La. Heere's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes
  3141  of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
  3142  Oh, oh, oh
  3143  
  3144     Doct. What a sigh is there? The hart is sorely charg'd
  3145  
  3146     Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,
  3147  for the dignity of the whole body
  3148  
  3149     Doct. Well, well, well
  3150  
  3151     Gent. Pray God it be sir
  3152  
  3153     Doct. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue
  3154  knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue
  3155  dyed holily in their beds
  3156  
  3157     Lad. Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,
  3158  looke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;
  3159  he cannot come out on's graue
  3160  
  3161     Doct. Euen so?
  3162    Lady. To bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate:
  3163  Come, come, come, come, giue me your hand: What's
  3164  done, cannot be vndone. To bed, to bed, to bed.
  3165  
  3166  Exit Lady.
  3167  
  3168    Doct. Will she go now to bed?
  3169    Gent. Directly
  3170  
  3171     Doct. Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds
  3172  Do breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes
  3173  To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:
  3174  More needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:
  3175  God, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,
  3176  Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,
  3177  And still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,
  3178  My minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.
  3179  I thinke, but dare not speake
  3180  
  3181     Gent. Good night good Doctor.

  3191    Ment. The English powre is neere, led on by Malcolm,
  3192  His Vnkle Seyward, and the good Macduff.
  3193  Reuenges burne in them: for their deere causes
  3194  Would to the bleeding, and the grim Alarme
  3195  Excite the mortified man
  3196  
  3197     Ang. Neere Byrnan wood
  3198  Shall we well meet them, that way are they comming
  3199  
  3200     Cath. Who knowes if Donalbane be with his brother?
  3201    Len. For certaine Sir, he is not: I haue a File
  3202  Of all the Gentry; there is Seywards Sonne,
  3203  And many vnruffe youths, that euen now
  3204  Protest their first of Manhood
  3205  
  3206     Ment. What do's the Tyrant
  3207  
  3208     Cath. Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies:
  3209  Some say hee's mad: Others, that lesser hate him,
  3210  Do call it valiant Fury, but for certaine
  3211  He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
  3212  Within the belt of Rule
  3213  
  3214     Ang. Now do's he feele
  3215  His secret Murthers sticking on his hands,
  3216  Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith-breach:
  3217  Those he commands, moue onely in command,
  3218  Nothing in loue: Now do's he feele his Title
  3219  Hang loose about him, like a Giants Robe
  3220  Vpon a dwarfish Theefe
  3221  
  3222     Ment. Who then shall blame
  3223  His pester'd Senses to recoyle, and start,
  3224  When all that is within him, do's condemne
  3225  It selfe, for being there
  3226  
  3227     Cath. Well, march we on,
  3228  To giue Obedience, where 'tis truly ow'd:
  3229  Meet we the Med'cine of the sickly Weale,
  3230  And with him poure we in our Countries purge,
  3231  Each drop of vs
  3232  
  3233     Lenox. Or so much as it needes,
  3234  To dew the Soueraigne Flower, and drowne the Weeds:
  3235  Make we our March towards Birnan.

  3240  Scaena Tertia.
  3241  
  3242  Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.
  3243  
  3244    Macb. Bring me no more Reports, let them flye all:
  3245  Till Byrnane wood remoue to Dunsinane,
  3246  I cannot taint with Feare. What's the Boy Malcolme?
  3247  Was he not borne of woman? The Spirits that know
  3248  All mortall Consequences, haue pronounc'd me thus:
  3249  Feare not Macbeth, no man that's borne of woman
  3250  Shall ere haue power vpon thee. Then fly false Thanes,
  3251  And mingle with the English Epicures,
  3252  The minde I sway by, and the heart I beare,
  3253  Shall neuer sagge with doubt, nor shake with feare.
  3254  Enter Seruant.
  3255  
  3256  The diuell damne thee blacke, thou cream-fac'd Loone:
  3257  Where got'st thou that Goose-looke
  3258  
  3259     Ser. There is ten thousand
  3260  
  3261     Macb. Geese Villaine?
  3262    Ser. Souldiers Sir
  3263  
  3264     Macb. Go pricke thy face, and ouer-red thy feare
  3265  Thou Lilly-liuer'd Boy. What Soldiers, Patch?
  3266  Death of thy Soule, those Linnen cheekes of thine
  3267  Are Counsailers to feare. What Soldiers Whay-face?
  3268    Ser. The English Force, so please you
  3269  
  3270     Macb. Take thy face hence. Seyton, I am sick at hart,
  3271  When I behold: Seyton, I say, this push
  3272  Will cheere me euer, or dis-eate me now.
  3273  I haue liu'd long enough: my way of life
  3274  Is falne into the Seare, the yellow Leafe,
  3275  And that which should accompany Old-Age,
  3276  As Honor, Loue, Obedience, Troopes of Friends,
  3277  I must not looke to haue: but in their steed,
  3278  Curses, not lowd but deepe, Mouth-honor, breath
  3279  Which the poore heart would faine deny, and dare not.
  3280  Seyton?
  3281  Enter Seyton.
  3282  
  3283    Sey. What's your gracious pleasure?
  3284    Macb. What Newes more?
  3285    Sey. All is confirm'd my Lord, which was reported
  3286  
  3287     Macb. Ile fight, till from my bones, my flesh be hackt.
  3288  Giue me my Armor
  3289  
  3290     Seyt. 'Tis not needed yet
  3291  
  3292     Macb. Ile put it on:
  3293  Send out moe Horses, skirre the Country round,
  3294  Hang those that talke of Feare. Giue me mine Armor:
  3295  How do's your Patient, Doctor?
  3296    Doct. Not so sicke my Lord,
  3297  As she is troubled with thicke-comming Fancies
  3298  That keepe her from her rest
  3299  
  3300     Macb. Cure of that:
  3301  Can'st thou not Minister to a minde diseas'd,
  3302  Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow,
  3303  Raze out the written troubles of the Braine,
  3304  And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote
  3305  Cleanse the stufft bosome, of that perillous stuffe
  3306  Which weighes vpon the heart?
  3307    Doct. Therein the Patient
  3308  Must minister to himselfe
  3309  
  3310     Macb. Throw Physicke to the Dogs, Ile none of it.
  3311  Come, put mine Armour on: giue me my Staffe:
  3312  Seyton, send out: Doctor, the Thanes flye from me:
  3313  Come sir, dispatch. If thou could'st Doctor, cast
  3314  The Water of my Land, finde her Disease,
  3315  And purge it to a sound and pristine Health,
  3316  I would applaud thee to the very Eccho,
  3317  That should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,
  3318  What Rubarb, Cyme, or what Purgatiue drugge
  3319  Would scowre these English hence: hear'st y of them?
  3320    Doct. I my good Lord: your Royall Preparation
  3321  Makes vs heare something
  3322  
  3323     Macb. Bring it after me:
  3324  I will not be affraid of Death and Bane,
  3325  Till Birnane Forrest come to Dunsinane
  3326  
  3327     Doct. Were I from Dunsinane away, and cleere,
  3328  Profit againe should hardly draw me heere.

  3342  
  3343     Seyw. What wood is this before vs?
  3344    Ment. The wood of Birnane
  3345  
  3346     Malc. Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough,
  3347  And bear't before him, thereby shall we shadow
  3348  The numbers of our Hoast, and make discouery
  3349  Erre in report of vs
  3350  
  3351     Sold. It shall be done
  3352  
  3353     Syw. We learne no other, but the confident Tyrant
  3354  Keepes still in Dunsinane, and will indure
  3355  Our setting downe befor't
  3356  
  3357     Malc. 'Tis his maine hope:
  3358  For where there is aduantage to be giuen,
  3359  Both more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt,
  3360  And none serue with him, but constrained things,
  3361  Whose hearts are absent too
  3362  
  3363     Macd. Let our iust Censures
  3364  Attend the true euent, and put we on
  3365  Industrious Souldiership
  3366  
  3367     Sey. The time approaches,
  3368  That will with due decision make vs know
  3369  What we shall say we haue, and what we owe:
  3370  Thoughts speculatiue, their vnsure hopes relate,
  3371  But certaine issue, stroakes must arbitrate,
  3372  Towards which, aduance the warre.

  3377  
  3378  Enter Macbeth, Seyton, & Souldiers, with Drum and Colours.
  3379  
  3380    Macb. Hang out our Banners on the outward walls,
  3381  The Cry is still, they come: our Castles strength
  3382  Will laugh a Siedge to scorne: Heere let them lye,
  3383  Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp:
  3384  Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours,
  3385  We might haue met them darefull, beard to beard,
  3386  And beate them backward home. What is that noyse?
  3387  
  3388  A Cry within of Women.
  3389  
  3390    Sey. It is the cry of women, my good Lord
  3391  
  3392     Macb. I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:
  3393  The time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'd
  3394  To heare a Night-shrieke, and my Fell of haire
  3395  Would at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirre
  3396  As life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,
  3397  Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
  3398  Cannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?
  3399    Sey. The Queene (my Lord) is dead
  3400  
  3401     Macb. She should haue dy'de heereafter;
  3402  There would haue beene a time for such a word:
  3403  To morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,
  3404  Creepes in this petty pace from day to day,
  3405  To the last Syllable of Recorded time:
  3406  And all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles
  3407  The way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,
  3408  Life's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,
  3409  That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,
  3410  And then is heard no more. It is a Tale
  3411  Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury
  3412  Signifying nothing.
  3413  Enter a Messenger.
  3414  
  3415  Thou com'st to vse thy Tongue: thy Story quickly
  3416  
  3417     Mes. Gracious my Lord,
  3418  I should report that which I say I saw,
  3419  But know not how to doo't
  3420  
  3421     Macb. Well, say sir
  3422  
  3423     Mes. As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill
  3424  I look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thought
  3425  The Wood began to moue
  3426  
  3427     Macb. Lyar, and Slaue
  3428  
  3429     Mes. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
  3430  Within this three Mile may you see it comming.
  3431  I say, a mouing Groue
  3432  
  3433     Macb. If thou speak'st false,
  3434  Vpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue
  3435  Till Famine cling thee: If thy speech be sooth,
  3436  I care not if thou dost for me as much.
  3437  I pull in Resolution, and begin
  3438  To doubt th' Equiuocation of the Fiend,
  3439  That lies like truth. Feare not, till Byrnane Wood
  3440  Do come to Dunsinane, and now a Wood
  3441  Comes toward Dunsinane. Arme, Arme, and out,
  3442  If this which he auouches, do's appeare,
  3443  There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.
  3444  I 'ginne to be a-weary of the Sun,
  3445  And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.
  3446  Ring the Alarum Bell, blow Winde, come wracke,
  3447  At least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.

  3456  
  3457    Mal. Now neere enough:
  3458  Your leauy Skreenes throw downe,
  3459  And shew like those you are: You (worthy Vnkle)
  3460  Shall with my Cosin your right Noble Sonne
  3461  Leade our first Battell. Worthy Macduffe, and wee
  3462  Shall take vpon's what else remaines to do,
  3463  According to our order
  3464  
  3465     Sey. Fare you well:
  3466  Do we but finde the Tyrants power to night,
  3467  Let vs be beaten, if we cannot fight
  3468  
  3469     Macd. Make all our Trumpets speak, giue the[m] all breath
  3470  Those clamorous Harbingers of Blood, & Death.

  3480  
  3481    Macb. They haue tied me to a stake, I cannot flye,
  3482  But Beare-like I must fight the course. What's he
  3483  That was not borne of Woman? Such a one
  3484  Am I to feare, or none.
  3485  Enter young Seyward.
  3486  
  3487    Y.Sey. What is thy name?
  3488    Macb. Thou'lt be affraid to heare it
  3489  
  3490     Y.Sey. No: though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter name
  3491  Then any is in hell
  3492  
  3493     Macb. My name's Macbeth
  3494  
  3495     Y.Sey. The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title
  3496  More hatefull to mine eare
  3497  
  3498     Macb. No: nor more fearefull
  3499  
  3500     Y.Sey. Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant, with my Sword
  3501  Ile proue the lye thou speak'st.
  3502  
  3503  Fight, and young Seyward slaine.
  3504  
  3505    Macb. Thou was't borne of woman;
  3506  But Swords I smile at, Weapons laugh to scorne,
  3507  Brandish'd by man that's of a Woman borne.
  3508  Enter.
  3509  
  3510  Alarums. Enter Macduffe.
  3511  
  3512    Macd. That way the noise is: Tyrant shew thy face,
  3513  If thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,
  3514  My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:
  3515  I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armes
  3516  Are hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou Macbeth,
  3517  Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge
  3518  I sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,
  3519  By this great clatter, one of greatest note
  3520  Seemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,
  3521  And more I begge not.
  3522  
  3523  Exit. Alarums.
  3524  
  3525  Enter Malcolme and Seyward.
  3526  
  3527    Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:
  3528  The Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,
  3529  The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,
  3530  The day almost it selfe professes yours,
  3531  And little is to do
  3532  
  3533     Malc. We haue met with Foes
  3534  That strike beside vs
  3535  
  3536     Sey. Enter Sir, the Castle.
  3537  
  3538  Exeunt. Alarum
  3539  
  3540  Enter Macbeth.
  3541  
  3542    Macb. Why should I play the Roman Foole, and dye
  3543  On mine owne sword? whiles I see liues, the gashes
  3544  Do better vpon them.
  3545  Enter Macduffe.
  3546  
  3547    Macd. Turne Hell-hound, turne
  3548  
  3549     Macb. Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:
  3550  But get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'd
  3551  With blood of thine already
  3552  
  3553     Macd. I haue no words,
  3554  My voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier Villaine
  3555  Then tearmes can giue thee out.
  3556  
  3557  Fight: Alarum
  3558  
  3559    Macb. Thou loosest labour
  3560  As easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre
  3561  With thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:
  3562  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,
  3563  I beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeld
  3564  To one of woman borne
  3565  
  3566     Macd. Dispaire thy Charme,
  3567  And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd
  3568  Tell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers womb
  3569  Vntimely ript
  3570  
  3571     Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;
  3572  For it hath Cow'd my better part of man:
  3573  And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,
  3574  That palter with vs in a double sence,
  3575  That keepe the word of promise to our eare,
  3576  And breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee
  3577  
  3578     Macd. Then yeeld thee Coward,
  3579  And liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.
  3580  Wee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters are
  3581  Painted vpon a pole, and vnder-writ,
  3582  Heere may you see the Tyrant
  3583  
  3584     Macb. I will not yeeld
  3585  To kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet,
  3586  And to be baited with the Rabbles curse.
  3587  Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane,
  3588  And thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,
  3589  Yet I will try the last. Before my body,
  3590  I throw my warlike Shield: Lay on Macduffe,
  3591  And damn'd be him, that first cries hold, enough.
  3592  
  3593  Exeunt. fighting. Alarums.
  3594  
  3595  Enter Fighting, and Macbeth slaine.
  3596  
  3597  Retreat, and Flourish. Enter with Drumme and Colours, Malcolm,
  3598  Seyward,
  3599  Rosse, Thanes, & Soldiers.
  3600  
  3601    Mal. I would the Friends we misse, were safe arriu'd
  3602  
  3603     Sey. Some must go off: and yet by these I see,
  3604  So great a day as this is cheapely bought
  3605  
  3606     Mal. Macduffe is missing, and your Noble Sonne
  3607  
  3608     Rosse. Your son my Lord, ha's paid a souldiers debt,
  3609  He onely liu'd but till he was a man,
  3610  The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'd
  3611  In the vnshrinking station where he fought,
  3612  But like a man he dy'de
  3613  
  3614     Sey. Then he is dead?
  3615    Rosse. I, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
  3616  Must not be measur'd by his worth, for then
  3617  It hath no end
  3618  
  3619     Sey. Had he his hurts before?
  3620    Rosse. I, on the Front
  3621  
  3622     Sey. Why then, Gods Soldier be he:
  3623  Had I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,
  3624  I would not wish them to a fairer death:
  3625  And so his Knell is knoll'd
  3626  
  3627     Mal. Hee's worth more sorrow,
  3628  and that Ile spend for him
  3629  
  3630     Sey. He's worth no more,
  3631  They say he parted well, and paid his score,
  3632  And so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.
  3633  Enter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.
  3634  
  3635    Macd. Haile King, for so thou art.
  3636  Behold where stands
  3637  Th' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:
  3638  I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,
  3639  That speake my salutation in their minds:
  3640  Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine.
  3641  Haile King of Scotland
  3642  
  3643     All. Haile King of Scotland.
  3644  
  3645  Flourish.
  3646  
  3647    Mal. We shall not spend a large expence of time,
  3648  Before we reckon with your seuerall loues,
  3649  And make vs euen with you. My Thanes and Kinsmen
  3650  Henceforth be Earles, the first that euer Scotland
  3651  In such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,
  3652  Which would be planted newly with the time,
  3653  As calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,
  3654  That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny,
  3655  Producing forth the cruell Ministers
  3656  Of this dead Butcher, and his Fiend-like Queene;
  3657  Who (as 'tis thought) by selfe and violent hands,
  3658  Tooke off her life. This, and what need full else
  3659  That call's vpon vs, by the Grace of Grace,
  3660  We will performe in measure, time, and place:
  3661  So thankes to all at once, and to each one,
  3662  Whom we inuite, to see vs Crown'd at Scone.
  3663  
  3664  Flourish. Exeunt Omnes.
  3665  
  3666  
  3667  FINIS. THE TRAGEDIE OF MACBETH.

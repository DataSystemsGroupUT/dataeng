   138  
   139  
   140    Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,
   141      In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
   142      From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
   143      Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
   144      From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
   145      A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
   146      Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
   147      Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
   148      The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
   149      And the continuance of their parents' rage,
   150      Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
   151      Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
   152      The which if you with patient ears attend,
   153      What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
   154                                                           [Exit.]

   159  ACT I. Scene I.
   160  Verona. A public place.
   161  
   162  Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
   163  of Capulet.
   164  
   165  
   166    Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
   167  
   168    Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
   169  
   170    Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
   171  
   172    Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
   173  
   174    Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
   175  
   176    Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
   177  
   178    Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
   179  
   180    Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
   181      Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
   182  
   183    Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
   184      the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
   185  
   186    Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
   187      wall.
   188  
   189    Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
   190      are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
   191      from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
   192  
   193    Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
   194  
   195    Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
   196      fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
   197      their heads.
   198  
   199    Greg. The heads of the maids?
   200  
   201    Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
   202      Take it in what sense thou wilt.
   203  
   204    Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.
   205  
   206    Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
   207      am a pretty piece of flesh.
   208  
   209    Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
   210      been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
   211      Montagues.
   212  
   213             Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].
   214  
   215  
   216    Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
   217  
   218    Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
   219  
   220    Samp. Fear me not.
   221  
   222    Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
   223  
   224    Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
   225  
   226    Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
   227  
   228    Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
   229      disgrace to them, if they bear it.
   230  
   231    Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
   232  
   233    Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
   234  
   235    Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
   236  
   237    Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
   238  
   239    Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.
   240  
   241    Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
   242      thumb, sir.
   243  
   244    Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
   245  
   246    Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
   247  
   248    Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
   249      you.
   250  
   251    Abr. No better.
   252  
   253    Samp. Well, sir.
   254  
   255                          Enter Benvolio.
   256  
   257  
   258    Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
   259      master's kinsmen.
   260  
   261    Samp. Yes, better, sir.
   262  
   263    Abr. You lie.
   264  
   265    Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
   266                                                       They fight.
   267  
   268    Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
   269      Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
   270  
   271                            Enter Tybalt.
   272  
   273  
   274    Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
   275      Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
   276  
   277    Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
   278      Or manage it to part these men with me.
   279  
   280    Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
   281      As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
   282      Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.
   283  
   284       Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
   285                            partisans.
   286  
   287  
   288    Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
   289  
   290    Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
   291  
   292             Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.
   293  
   294  
   295    Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
   296  
   297    Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
   298  
   299    Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
   300      And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
   301  
   302                   Enter Old Montague and his Wife.
   303  
   304  
   305    Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
   306  
   307    M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
   308  
   309                  Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.
   310  
   311  
   312    Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
   313      Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
   314      Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
   315      That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
   316      With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
   317      On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
   318      Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
   319      And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
   320      Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
   321      By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
   322      Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
   323      And made Verona's ancient citizens
   324      Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
   325      To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
   326      Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
   327      If ever you disturb our streets again,
   328      Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
   329      For this time all the rest depart away.
   330      You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
   331      And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
   332      To know our farther pleasure in this case,
   333      To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
   334      Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
   335                Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].
   336  
   337    Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
   338      Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
   339  
   340    Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
   341      And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
   342      I drew to part them. In the instant came
   343      The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
   344      Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
   345      He swung about his head and cut the winds,
   346      Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
   347      While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
   348      Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
   349      Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
   350  
   351    M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
   352      Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
   353  
   354    Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
   355      Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
   356      A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
   357      Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
   358      That westward rooteth from the city's side,
   359      So early walking did I see your son.
   360      Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
   361      And stole into the covert of the wood.
   362      I- measuring his affections by my own,
   363      Which then most sought where most might not be found,
   364      Being one too many by my weary self-
   365      Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
   366      And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
   367  
   368    Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
   369      With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
   370      Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
   371      But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
   372      Should in the furthest East bean to draw
   373      The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
   374      Away from light steals home my heavy son
   375      And private in his chamber pens himself,
   376      Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
   377      And makes himself an artificial night.
   378      Black and portentous must this humour prove
   379      Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
   380  
   381    Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
   382  
   383    Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him
   384  
   385    Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
   386  
   387    Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
   388      But he, his own affections' counsellor,
   389      Is to himself- I will not say how true-
   390      But to himself so secret and so close,
   391      So far from sounding and discovery,
   392      As is the bud bit with an envious worm
   393      Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
   394      Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
   395      Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
   396      We would as willingly give cure as know.
   397  
   398                         Enter Romeo.
   399  
   400  
   401    Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
   402      I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
   403  
   404    Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
   405      To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
   406                                       Exeunt [Montague and Wife].
   407  
   408    Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
   409  
   410    Rom. Is the day so young?
   411  
   412    Ben. But new struck nine.
   413  
   414    Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
   415      Was that my father that went hence so fast?
   416  
   417    Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
   418  
   419    Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.
   420  
   421    Ben. In love?
   422  
   423    Rom. Out-
   424  
   425    Ben. Of love?
   426  
   427    Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
   428  
   429    Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
   430      Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
   431  
   432    Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
   433      Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
   434      Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
   435      Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
   436      Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
   437      Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
   438      O anything, of nothing first create!
   439      O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
   440      Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
   441      Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
   442      Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
   443      This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
   444      Dost thou not laugh?
   445  
   446    Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
   447  
   448    Rom. Good heart, at what?
   449  
   450    Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.
   451  
   452    Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
   453      Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
   454      Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
   455      With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
   456      Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
   457      Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
   458      Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
   459      Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
   460      What is it else? A madness most discreet,
   461      A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
   462      Farewell, my coz.
   463  
   464    Ben. Soft! I will go along.
   465      An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
   466  
   467    Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
   468      This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
   469  
   470    Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
   471  
   472    Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
   473  
   474    Ben. Groan? Why, no;
   475      But sadly tell me who.
   476  
   477    Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
   478      Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
   479      In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
   480  
   481    Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
   482  
   483    Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
   484  
   485    Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
   486  
   487    Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
   488      With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
   489      And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
   490      From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
   491      She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
   492      Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
   493      Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
   494      O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
   495      That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
   496  
   497    Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
   498  
   499    Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
   500      For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
   501      Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
   502      She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
   503      To merit bliss by making me despair.
   504      She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
   505      Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
   506  
   507    Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
   508  
   509    Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
   510  
   511    Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
   512      Examine other beauties.
   513  
   514    Rom. 'Tis the way
   515      To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
   516      These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
   517      Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
   518      He that is strucken blind cannot forget
   519      The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
   520      Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
   521      What doth her beauty serve but as a note
   522      Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
   523      Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
   524  
   525    Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.
   526

   530  Scene II.
   531  A Street.
   532  
   533  Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.
   534  
   535  
   536    Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
   537      In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
   538      For men so old as we to keep the peace.
   539  
   540    Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
   541      And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
   542      But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
   543  
   544    Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
   545      My child is yet a stranger in the world,
   546      She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
   547      Let two more summers wither in their pride
   548      Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
   549  
   550    Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
   551  
   552    Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
   553      The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
   554      She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
   555      But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
   556      My will to her consent is but a part.
   557      An she agree, within her scope of choice
   558      Lies my consent and fair according voice.
   559      This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
   560      Whereto I have invited many a guest,
   561      Such as I love; and you among the store,
   562      One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
   563      At my poor house look to behold this night
   564      Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
   565      Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
   566      When well apparell'd April on the heel
   567      Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
   568      Among fresh female buds shall you this night
   569      Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
   570      And like her most whose merit most shall be;
   571      Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
   572      May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
   573      Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,
   574      sirrah, trudge about
   575      Through fair Verona; find those persons out
   576      Whose names are written there, and to them say,
   577      My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
   578                                       Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].
   579  
   580    Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
   581      that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
   582      with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
   583      with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
   584      here writ, and can never find what names the writing person
   585      hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!
   586  
   587                     Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
   588  
   589  
   590    Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
   591      One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
   592      Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
   593      One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
   594      Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
   595      And the rank poison of the old will die.
   596  
   597    Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
   598  
   599    Ben. For what, I pray thee?
   600  
   601    Rom. For your broken shin.
   602  
   603    Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
   604  
   605    Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
   606      Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
   607      Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.
   608  
   609    Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
   610  
   611    Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
   612  
   613    Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
   614      you read anything you see?
   615  
   616    Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
   617  
   618    Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
   619  
   620    Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
   621  
   622        'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
   623        County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
   624        The lady widow of Vitruvio;
   625        Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
   626        Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
   627        Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
   628        My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
   629        Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
   630        Lucio and the lively Helena.'
   631  
   632      [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
   633      come?
   634  
   635    Serv. Up.
   636  
   637    Rom. Whither?
   638  
   639    Serv. To supper, to our house.
   640  
   641    Rom. Whose house?
   642  
   643    Serv. My master's.
   644  
   645    Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
   646  
   647    Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
   648      rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
   649      come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.
   650  
   651    Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
   652      Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
   653      With all the admired beauties of Verona.
   654      Go thither, and with unattainted eye
   655      Compare her face with some that I shall show,
   656      And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
   657  
   658    Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
   659      Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
   660      And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
   661      Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
   662      One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
   663      Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
   664  
   665    Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
   666      Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
   667      But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
   668      Your lady's love against some other maid
   669      That I will show you shining at this feast,
   670      And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
   671  
   672    Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
   673      But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]
   674

   677  
   678  Scene III.
   679  Capulet's house.
   680  
   681  Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.
   682  
   683  
   684    Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
   685  
   686    Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
   687      I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
   688      God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
   689  
   690                           Enter Juliet.
   691  
   692  
   693    Jul. How now? Who calls?
   694  
   695    Nurse. Your mother.
   696  
   697    Jul. Madam, I am here.
   698      What is your will?
   699  
   700    Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
   701      We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
   702      I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
   703      Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
   704  
   705    Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
   706  
   707    Wife. She's not fourteen.
   708  
   709    Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
   710      And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
   711      She is not fourteen. How long is it now
   712      To Lammastide?
   713  
   714    Wife. A fortnight and odd days.
   715  
   716    Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
   717      Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
   718      Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
   719      Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
   720      She was too good for me. But, as I said,
   721      On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
   722      That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
   723      'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
   724      And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
   725      Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
   726      For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
   727      Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
   728      My lord and you were then at Mantua.
   729      Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
   730      When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
   731      Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
   732      To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
   733      Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
   734      To bid me trudge.
   735      And since that time it is eleven years,
   736      For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
   737      She could have run and waddled all about;
   738      For even the day before, she broke her brow;
   739      And then my husband (God be with his soul!
   740      'A was a merry man) took up the child.
   741      'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
   742      Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
   743      Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
   744      The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
   745      To see now how a jest shall come about!
   746      I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
   747      I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
   748      And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
   749  
   750    Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
   751  
   752    Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
   753      To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
   754      And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
   755      A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
   756      A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
   757      'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
   758      Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
   759      Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
   760  
   761    Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
   762  
   763    Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
   764      Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
   765      An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
   766  
   767    Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
   768      I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
   769      How stands your disposition to be married?
   770  
   771    Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
   772  
   773    Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
   774      I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
   775  
   776    Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
   777      Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
   778      Are made already mothers. By my count,
   779      I was your mother much upon these years
   780      That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
   781      The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
   782  
   783    Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
   784      As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
   785  
   786    Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
   787  
   788    Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
   789  
   790    Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
   791      This night you shall behold him at our feast.
   792      Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
   793      And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
   794      Examine every married lineament,
   795      And see how one another lends content;
   796      And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
   797      Find written in the margent of his eyes,
   798      This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
   799      To beautify him only lacks a cover.
   800      The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
   801      For fair without the fair within to hide.
   802      That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
   803      That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
   804      So shall you share all that he doth possess,
   805      By having him making yourself no less.
   806  
   807    Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
   808  
   809    Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
   810  
   811    Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
   812      But no more deep will I endart mine eye
   813      Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
   814  
   815                          Enter Servingman.
   816  
   817  
   818    Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
   819      my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
   820      everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
   821      follow straight.
   822  
   823    Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
   824      Juliet, the County stays.
   825  
   826    Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
   827                                                           Exeunt.

   831  
   832  Scene IV.
   833  A street.
   834  
   835  Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
   836  Torchbearers.
   837  
   838  
   839    Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
   840      Or shall we on without apology?
   841  
   842    Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
   843      We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
   844      Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
   845      Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
   846      Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
   847      After the prompter, for our entrance;
   848      But, let them measure us by what they will,
   849      We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
   850  
   851    Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
   852      Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
   853  
   854    Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
   855  
   856    Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
   857      With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
   858      So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
   859  
   860    Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
   861      And soar with them above a common bound.
   862  
   863    Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
   864      To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
   865      I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
   866      Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
   867  
   868    Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
   869      Too great oppression for a tender thing.
   870  
   871    Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
   872      Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
   873  
   874    Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
   875      Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
   876      Give me a case to put my visage in.
   877      A visor for a visor! What care I
   878      What curious eye doth quote deformities?
   879      Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
   880  
   881    Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
   882      But every man betake him to his legs.
   883  
   884    Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
   885      Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
   886      For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
   887      I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
   888      The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
   889  
   890    Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
   891      If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
   892      Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
   893      Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
   894  
   895    Rom. Nay, that's not so.
   896  
   897    Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
   898      We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
   899      Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
   900      Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
   901  
   902    Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
   903      But 'tis no wit to go.
   904  
   905    Mer. Why, may one ask?
   906  
   907    Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
   908  
   909    Mer. And so did I.
   910  
   911    Rom. Well, what was yours?
   912  
   913    Mer. That dreamers often lie.
   914  
   915    Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
   916  
   917    Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
   918      She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
   919      In shape no bigger than an agate stone
   920      On the forefinger of an alderman,
   921      Drawn with a team of little atomies
   922      Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
   923      Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
   924      The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
   925      Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
   926      Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
   927      Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
   928      Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
   929      Not half so big as a round little worm
   930      Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
   931      Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
   932      Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
   933      Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
   934      And in this state she 'gallops night by night
   935      Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
   936      O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
   937      O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
   938      O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
   939      Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
   940      Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
   941      Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
   942      And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
   943      And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
   944      Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
   945      Then dreams he of another benefice.
   946      Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
   947      And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
   948      Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
   949      Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
   950      Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
   951      And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
   952      And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
   953      That plats the manes of horses in the night
   954      And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
   955      Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
   956      This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
   957      That presses them and learns them first to bear,
   958      Making them women of good carriage.
   959      This is she-
   960  
   961    Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
   962      Thou talk'st of nothing.
   963  
   964    Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
   965      Which are the children of an idle brain,
   966      Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
   967      Which is as thin of substance as the air,
   968      And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
   969      Even now the frozen bosom of the North
   970      And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
   971      Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.
   972  
   973    Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
   974      Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
   975  
   976    Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
   977      Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
   978      Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
   979      With this night's revels and expire the term
   980      Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
   981      By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
   982      But he that hath the steerage of my course
   983      Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
   984  
   985    Ben. Strike, drum.
   986                             They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]

   991  Scene V.
   992  Capulet's house.
   993  
   994  Servingmen come forth with napkins.
   995  
   996    1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
   997      He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
   998    2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
   999      hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
  1000    1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
  1001      look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
  1002      thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
  1003  Nell.
  1004      Anthony, and Potpan!
  1005    2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
  1006    1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
  1007      sought for, in the great chamber.
  1008    3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
  1009      Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.
  1010  
  1011      Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
  1012                Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
  1013                 and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
  1014  
  1015  
  1016    Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
  1017      Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
  1018      Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
  1019      Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
  1020      She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
  1021      Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
  1022      That I have worn a visor and could tell
  1023      A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
  1024      Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
  1025      You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
  1026      A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
  1027                                      Music plays, and they dance.
  1028      More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
  1029      And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
  1030      Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
  1031      Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
  1032      For you and I are past our dancing days.
  1033      How long is't now since last yourself and I
  1034      Were in a mask?
  1035    2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.
  1036  
  1037    Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
  1038      'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
  1039      Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
  1040      Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
  1041    2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
  1042      His son is thirty.
  1043  
  1044    Cap. Will you tell me that?
  1045      His son was but a ward two years ago.
  1046  
  1047    Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
  1048      hand Of yonder knight?
  1049  
  1050    Serv. I know not, sir.
  1051  
  1052    Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
  1053      It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
  1054      Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
  1055      Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
  1056      So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
  1057      As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
  1058      The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
  1059      And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
  1060      Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
  1061      For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
  1062  
  1063    Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
  1064      Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
  1065      Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
  1066      To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
  1067      Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
  1068      To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
  1069  
  1070    Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
  1071  
  1072    Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
  1073      A villain, that is hither come in spite
  1074      To scorn at our solemnity this night.
  1075  
  1076    Cap. Young Romeo is it?
  1077  
  1078    Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
  1079  
  1080    Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
  1081      'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
  1082      And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
  1083      To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
  1084      I would not for the wealth of all this town
  1085      Here in my house do him disparagement.
  1086      Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
  1087      It is my will; the which if thou respect,
  1088      Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
  1089      An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
  1090  
  1091    Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
  1092      I'll not endure him.
  1093  
  1094    Cap. He shall be endur'd.
  1095      What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
  1096      Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
  1097      You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
  1098      You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
  1099      You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
  1100  
  1101    Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
  1102  
  1103    Cap. Go to, go to!
  1104      You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
  1105      This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
  1106      You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
  1107      Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
  1108      Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
  1109      I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
  1110  
  1111    Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
  1112      Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
  1113      I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
  1114      Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.
  1115  
  1116    Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
  1117      This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
  1118      My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
  1119      To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
  1120  
  1121    Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
  1122      Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
  1123      For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
  1124      And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
  1125  
  1126    Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
  1127  
  1128    Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
  1129  
  1130    Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
  1131      They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
  1132  
  1133    Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
  1134  
  1135    Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
  1136      Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]
  1137  
  1138    Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
  1139  
  1140    Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
  1141      Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]
  1142  
  1143    Jul. You kiss by th' book.
  1144  
  1145    Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
  1146  
  1147    Rom. What is her mother?
  1148  
  1149    Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
  1150      Her mother is the lady of the house.
  1151      And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
  1152      I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
  1153      I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
  1154      Shall have the chinks.
  1155  
  1156    Rom. Is she a Capulet?
  1157      O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
  1158  
  1159    Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
  1160  
  1161    Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
  1162  
  1163    Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
  1164      We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
  1165      Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
  1166      I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
  1167      More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
  1168      Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
  1169      I'll to my rest.
  1170                                Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].
  1171  
  1172    Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
  1173  
  1174    Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
  1175  
  1176    Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
  1177  
  1178    Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
  1179  
  1180    Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
  1181  
  1182    Nurse. I know not.
  1183  
  1184    Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
  1185      My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
  1186  
  1187    Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
  1188      The only son of your great enemy.
  1189  
  1190    Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
  1191      Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
  1192      Prodigious birth of love it is to me
  1193      That I must love a loathed enemy.
  1194  
  1195    Nurse. What's this? what's this?
  1196  
  1197    Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
  1198      Of one I danc'd withal.
  1199                                       One calls within, 'Juliet.'
  1200  
  1201    Nurse. Anon, anon!
  1202      Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.

  1210  
  1211  
  1212    Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
  1213      And young affection gapes to be his heir;
  1214      That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
  1215      With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
  1216      Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
  1217      Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
  1218      But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
  1219      And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
  1220      Being held a foe, he may not have access
  1221      To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
  1222      And she as much in love, her means much less
  1223      To meet her new beloved anywhere;
  1224      But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
  1225      Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
  1226  Exit.

  1234  Enter Romeo alone.
  1235  
  1236  
  1237    Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
  1238      Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
  1239                       [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
  1240  
  1241                     Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.
  1242  
  1243  
  1244    Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
  1245  
  1246    Mer. He is wise,
  1247      And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
  1248  
  1249    Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
  1250      Call, good Mercutio.
  1251  
  1252    Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
  1253      Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
  1254      Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
  1255      Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
  1256      Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
  1257      Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
  1258      One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
  1259      Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
  1260      When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
  1261      He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
  1262      The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
  1263      I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
  1264      By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
  1265      By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
  1266      And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
  1267      That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
  1268  
  1269    Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
  1270  
  1271    Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
  1272      To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
  1273      Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
  1274      Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
  1275      That were some spite; my invocation
  1276      Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
  1277      I conjure only but to raise up him.
  1278  
  1279    Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
  1280      To be consorted with the humorous night.
  1281      Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
  1282  
  1283    Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
  1284      Now will he sit under a medlar tree
  1285      And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
  1286      As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
  1287      O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
  1288      An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
  1289      Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
  1290      This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
  1291      Come, shall we go?
  1292  
  1293    Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
  1294      'To seek him here that means not to be found.
  1295                                                           Exeunt.
  1296  
  1297  
  1298  
  1299  
  1300  Scene II.
  1301  Capulet's orchard.
  1302  
  1303  Enter Romeo.
  1304  
  1305  
  1306    Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
  1307  
  1308                       Enter Juliet above at a window.
  1309  
  1310      But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
  1311      It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
  1312      Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
  1313      Who is already sick and pale with grief
  1314      That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
  1315      Be not her maid, since she is envious.
  1316      Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
  1317      And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
  1318      It is my lady; O, it is my love!
  1319      O that she knew she were!
  1320      She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
  1321      Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
  1322      I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
  1323      Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
  1324      Having some business, do entreat her eyes
  1325      To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
  1326      What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
  1327      The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
  1328      As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
  1329      Would through the airy region stream so bright
  1330      That birds would sing and think it were not night.
  1331      See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
  1332      O that I were a glove upon that hand,
  1333      That I might touch that cheek!
  1334  
  1335    Jul. Ay me!
  1336  
  1337    Rom. She speaks.
  1338      O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
  1339      As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
  1340      As is a winged messenger of heaven
  1341      Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
  1342      Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
  1343      When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
  1344      And sails upon the bosom of the air.
  1345  
  1346    Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
  1347      Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
  1348      Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
  1349      And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
  1350  
  1351    Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
  1352  
  1353    Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
  1354      Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
  1355      What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
  1356      Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
  1357      Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
  1358      What's in a name? That which we call a rose
  1359      By any other name would smell as sweet.
  1360      So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
  1361      Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  1362      Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
  1363      And for that name, which is no part of thee,
  1364      Take all myself.
  1365  
  1366    Rom. I take thee at thy word.
  1367      Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
  1368      Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
  1369  
  1370    Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
  1371      So stumblest on my counsel?
  1372  
  1373    Rom. By a name
  1374      I know not how to tell thee who I am.
  1375      My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
  1376      Because it is an enemy to thee.
  1377      Had I it written, I would tear the word.
  1378  
  1379    Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
  1380      Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
  1381      Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
  1382  
  1383    Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  1384  
  1385    Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
  1386      The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
  1387      And the place death, considering who thou art,
  1388      If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
  1389  
  1390    Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
  1391      For stony limits cannot hold love out,
  1392      And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
  1393      Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
  1394  
  1395    Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
  1396  
  1397    Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
  1398      Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
  1399      And I am proof against their enmity.
  1400  
  1401    Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
  1402  
  1403    Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
  1404      And but thou love me, let them find me here.
  1405      My life were better ended by their hate
  1406      Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
  1407  
  1408    Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
  1409  
  1410    Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
  1411      He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
  1412      I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
  1413      As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
  1414      I would adventure for such merchandise.
  1415  
  1416    Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
  1417      Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  1418      For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
  1419      Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
  1420      What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
  1421      Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
  1422      And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
  1423      Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
  1424      They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
  1425      If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
  1426      Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
  1427      I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
  1428      So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
  1429      In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
  1430      And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
  1431      But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
  1432      Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
  1433      I should have been more strange, I must confess,
  1434      But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
  1435      My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
  1436      And not impute this yielding to light love,
  1437      Which the dark night hath so discovered.
  1438  
  1439    Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
  1440      That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
  1441  
  1442    Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
  1443      That monthly changes in her circled orb,
  1444      Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
  1445  
  1446    Rom. What shall I swear by?
  1447  
  1448    Jul. Do not swear at all;
  1449      Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
  1450      Which is the god of my idolatry,
  1451      And I'll believe thee.
  1452  
  1453    Rom. If my heart's dear love-
  1454  
  1455    Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
  1456      I have no joy of this contract to-night.
  1457      It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
  1458      Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
  1459      Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  1460      This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
  1461      May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
  1462      Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
  1463      Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
  1464  
  1465    Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  1466  
  1467    Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
  1468  
  1469    Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
  1470  
  1471    Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
  1472      And yet I would it were to give again.
  1473  
  1474    Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
  1475  
  1476    Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
  1477      And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
  1478      My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
  1479      My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
  1480      The more I have, for both are infinite.
  1481      I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
  1482                                             [Nurse] calls within.
  1483      Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
  1484      Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]
  1485  
  1486    Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
  1487      Being in night, all this is but a dream,
  1488      Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
  1489  
  1490                         Enter Juliet above.
  1491  
  1492  
  1493    Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
  1494      If that thy bent of love be honourable,
  1495      Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
  1496      By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
  1497      Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
  1498      And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
  1499      And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
  1500  
  1501    Nurse. (within) Madam!
  1502  
  1503    Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
  1504      I do beseech thee-
  1505  
  1506    Nurse. (within) Madam!
  1507  
  1508    Jul. By-and-by I come.-
  1509      To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
  1510      To-morrow will I send.
  1511  
  1512    Rom. So thrive my soul-
  1513  
  1514    Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.
  1515  
  1516    Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
  1517      Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
  1518      But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
  1519  
  1520                       Enter Juliet again, [above].
  1521  
  1522  
  1523    Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
  1524      To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
  1525      Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
  1526      Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  1527      And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
  1528      With repetition of my Romeo's name.
  1529      Romeo!
  1530  
  1531    Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
  1532      How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
  1533      Like softest music to attending ears!
  1534  
  1535    Jul. Romeo!
  1536  
  1537    Rom. My dear?
  1538  
  1539    Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
  1540      Shall I send to thee?
  1541  
  1542    Rom. By the hour of nine.
  1543  
  1544    Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
  1545      I have forgot why I did call thee back.
  1546  
  1547    Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
  1548  
  1549    Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
  1550      Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
  1551  
  1552    Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
  1553      Forgetting any other home but this.
  1554  
  1555    Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
  1556      And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
  1557      That lets it hop a little from her hand,
  1558      Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
  1559      And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
  1560      So loving-jealous of his liberty.
  1561  
  1562    Rom. I would I were thy bird.
  1563  
  1564    Jul. Sweet, so would I.
  1565      Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
  1566      Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
  1567      That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
  1568                                                           [Exit.]
  1569  
  1570    Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
  1571      Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
  1572      Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
  1573      His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
  1574   Exit
  1575  
  1576  
  1577  
  1578  
  1579  Scene III.
  1580  Friar Laurence's cell.
  1581  
  1582  Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.
  1583  
  1584  
  1585    Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
  1586      Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
  1587      And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
  1588      From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
  1589      Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
  1590      The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
  1591      I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
  1592      With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
  1593      The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
  1594      What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
  1595      And from her womb children of divers kind
  1596      We sucking on her natural bosom find;
  1597      Many for many virtues excellent,
  1598      None but for some, and yet all different.
  1599      O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
  1600      In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
  1601      For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
  1602      But to the earth some special good doth give;
  1603      Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
  1604      Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
  1605      Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
  1606      And vice sometime's by action dignified.
  1607      Within the infant rind of this small flower
  1608      Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
  1609      For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
  1610      Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
  1611      Two such opposed kings encamp them still
  1612      In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
  1613      And where the worser is predominant,
  1614      Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
  1615  
  1616                          Enter Romeo.
  1617  
  1618  
  1619    Rom. Good morrow, father.
  1620  
  1621    Friar. Benedicite!
  1622      What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
  1623      Young son, it argues a distempered head
  1624      So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
  1625      Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
  1626      And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
  1627      But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
  1628      Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
  1629      Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
  1630      Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
  1631      Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
  1632      Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
  1633  
  1634    Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
  1635  
  1636    Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
  1637  
  1638    Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
  1639      I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
  1640  
  1641    Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
  1642  
  1643    Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
  1644      I have been feasting with mine enemy,
  1645      Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
  1646      That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
  1647      Within thy help and holy physic lies.
  1648      I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
  1649      My intercession likewise steads my foe.
  1650  
  1651    Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
  1652      Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  1653  
  1654    Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
  1655      On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
  1656      As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
  1657      And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
  1658      By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
  1659      We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
  1660      I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
  1661      That thou consent to marry us to-day.
  1662  
  1663    Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
  1664      Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
  1665      So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
  1666      Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
  1667      Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
  1668      Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
  1669      How much salt water thrown away in waste,
  1670      To season love, that of it doth not taste!
  1671      The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
  1672      Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
  1673      Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
  1674      Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
  1675      If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
  1676      Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
  1677      And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
  1678      Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
  1679  
  1680    Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
  1681  
  1682    Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
  1683  
  1684    Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
  1685  
  1686    Friar. Not in a grave
  1687      To lay one in, another out to have.
  1688  
  1689    Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
  1690      Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
  1691      The other did not so.
  1692  
  1693    Friar. O, she knew well
  1694      Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
  1695      But come, young waverer, come go with me.
  1696      In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
  1697      For this alliance may so happy prove
  1698      To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
  1699  
  1700    Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
  1701  
  1702    Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
  1703                                                           Exeunt.

  1707  
  1708  Scene IV.
  1709  A street.
  1710  
  1711  Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
  1712  
  1713  
  1714    Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
  1715      Came he not home to-night?
  1716  
  1717    Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
  1718  
  1719    Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
  1720      Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
  1721  
  1722    Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
  1723      Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
  1724  
  1725    Mer. A challenge, on my life.
  1726  
  1727    Ben. Romeo will answer it.
  1728  
  1729    Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.
  1730  
  1731    Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
  1732      being dared.
  1733  
  1734    Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
  1735      wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
  1736      very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
  1737      butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
  1738  
  1739    Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?
  1740  
  1741    Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
  1742      courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
  1743      pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
  1744      minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
  1745      butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
  1746      of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
  1747      immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.
  1748  
  1749    Ben. The what?
  1750  
  1751    Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
  1752      these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
  1753      tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
  1754      grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
  1755      flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
  1756      so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
  1757      bench? O, their bones, their bones!
  1758  
  1759                                 Enter Romeo.
  1760  
  1761  
  1762    Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
  1763  
  1764    Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
  1765      art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
  1766      flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
  1767      had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
  1768      Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
  1769      but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
  1770      salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
  1771      fairly last night.
  1772  
  1773    Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
  1774  
  1775    Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
  1776  
  1777    Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
  1778      case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
  1779  
  1780    Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
  1781      man to bow in the hams.
  1782  
  1783    Rom. Meaning, to cursy.
  1784  
  1785    Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.
  1786  
  1787    Rom. A most courteous exposition.
  1788  
  1789    Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
  1790  
  1791    Rom. Pink for flower.
  1792  
  1793    Mer. Right.
  1794  
  1795    Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
  1796  
  1797    Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
  1798      thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
  1799      remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
  1800  
  1801    Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
  1802  
  1803    Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
  1804  
  1805    Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
  1806  
  1807    Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
  1808      thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
  1809      sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
  1810  
  1811    Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
  1812      there for the goose.
  1813  
  1814    Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
  1815  
  1816    Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!
  1817  
  1818    Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
  1819  
  1820    Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
  1821  
  1822    Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
  1823      narrow to an ell broad!
  1824  
  1825    Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
  1826      the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
  1827  
  1828    Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
  1829      art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
  1830      art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
  1831      great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
  1832      a hole.
  1833  
  1834    Ben. Stop there, stop there!
  1835  
  1836    Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
  1837  
  1838    Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
  1839  
  1840    Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
  1841      was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
  1842      occupy the argument no longer.
  1843  
  1844    Rom. Here's goodly gear!
  1845  
  1846                        Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].
  1847  
  1848  
  1849    Mer. A sail, a sail!
  1850  
  1851    Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
  1852  
  1853    Nurse. Peter!
  1854  
  1855    Peter. Anon.
  1856  
  1857    Nurse. My fan, Peter.
  1858  
  1859    Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
  1860      the two.
  1861  
  1862    Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
  1863  
  1864    Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
  1865  
  1866    Nurse. Is it good-den?
  1867  
  1868    Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
  1869      now upon the prick of noon.
  1870  
  1871    Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
  1872  
  1873    Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
  1874  
  1875    Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
  1876      quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the
  1877      young Romeo?
  1878  
  1879    Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
  1880      have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
  1881      of that name, for fault of a worse.
  1882  
  1883    Nurse. You say well.
  1884  
  1885    Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
  1886      wisely.
  1887  
  1888    Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
  1889  
  1890    Ben. She will endite him to some supper.
  1891  
  1892    Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
  1893  
  1894    Rom. What hast thou found?
  1895  
  1896    Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
  1897      something stale and hoar ere it be spent
  1898                                       He walks by them and sings.
  1899  
  1900                     An old hare hoar,
  1901                     And an old hare hoar,
  1902                  Is very good meat in Lent;
  1903                     But a hare that is hoar
  1904                     Is too much for a score
  1905                  When it hoars ere it be spent.
  1906  
  1907      Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
  1908  
  1909    Rom. I will follow you.
  1910  
  1911    Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
  1912      [sings] lady, lady, lady.
  1913                                        Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.
  1914  
  1915    Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
  1916      was this that was so full of his ropery?
  1917  
  1918    Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
  1919      will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
  1920  
  1921    Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
  1922  'a
  1923      were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,
  1924      I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
  1925      flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
  1926      stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
  1927  
  1928    Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
  1929      weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
  1930      soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
  1931      law on my side.
  1932  
  1933    Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
  1934      quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
  1935      my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I
  1936      will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
  1937      her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
  1938      behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
  1939      therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
  1940      an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
  1941  
  1942    Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
  1943      thee-
  1944  
  1945    Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
  1946      Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
  1947  
  1948    Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
  1949  
  1950    Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
  1951      take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
  1952  
  1953    Rom. Bid her devise
  1954      Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
  1955      And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
  1956      Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
  1957  
  1958    Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
  1959  
  1960    Rom. Go to! I say you shall.
  1961  
  1962    Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
  1963  
  1964    Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
  1965      Within this hour my man shall be with thee
  1966      And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
  1967      Which to the high topgallant of my joy
  1968      Must be my convoy in the secret night.
  1969      Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
  1970      Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
  1971  
  1972    Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
  1973  
  1974    Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
  1975  
  1976    Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
  1977      Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
  1978  
  1979    Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
  1980  
  1981    Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
  1982      when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
  1983      town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,
  1984      good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I
  1985      anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
  1986      but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
  1987      clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
  1988      with a letter?
  1989  
  1990    Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
  1991  
  1992    Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
  1993      know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
  1994      sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
  1995      good to hear it.
  1996  
  1997    Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
  1998  
  1999    Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
  2000  
  2001    Peter. Anon.
  2002  
  2003    Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
  2004                                                           Exeunt.

  2009  Scene V.
  2010  Capulet's orchard.
  2011  
  2012  Enter Juliet.
  2013  
  2014  
  2015    Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
  2016      In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
  2017      Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
  2018      O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
  2019      Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
  2020      Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
  2021      Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
  2022      And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
  2023      Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
  2024      Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
  2025      Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
  2026      Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
  2027      She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
  2028      My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
  2029      And his to me,
  2030      But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
  2031      Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
  2032  
  2033                        Enter Nurse [and Peter].
  2034  
  2035      O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
  2036      Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
  2037  
  2038    Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
  2039                                                     [Exit Peter.]
  2040  
  2041    Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
  2042      Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
  2043      If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
  2044      By playing it to me with so sour a face.
  2045  
  2046    Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
  2047      Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
  2048  
  2049    Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
  2050      Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
  2051  
  2052    Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
  2053      Do you not see that I am out of breath?
  2054  
  2055    Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
  2056      To say to me that thou art out of breath?
  2057      The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
  2058      Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
  2059      Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
  2060      Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
  2061      Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  2062  
  2063    Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
  2064      choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
  2065      than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
  2066      foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
  2067      they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
  2068      warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
  2069  God.
  2070      What, have you din'd at home?
  2071  
  2072    Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
  2073      What says he of our marriage? What of that?
  2074  
  2075    Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
  2076      It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
  2077      My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
  2078      Beshrew your heart for sending me about
  2079      To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
  2080  
  2081    Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
  2082      Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
  2083  
  2084    Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
  2085      and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
  2086      is your mother?
  2087  
  2088    Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
  2089      Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
  2090      'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
  2091      "Where is your mother?"'
  2092  
  2093    Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
  2094      Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
  2095      Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
  2096      Henceforward do your messages yourself.
  2097  
  2098    Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
  2099  
  2100    Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
  2101  
  2102    Jul. I have.
  2103  
  2104    Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
  2105      There stays a husband to make you a wife.
  2106      Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
  2107      They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
  2108      Hie you to church; I must another way,
  2109      To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
  2110      Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
  2111      I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
  2112      But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
  2113      Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
  2114  
  2115    Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
  2116                                                           Exeunt.
  2117  
  2118  
  2119  
  2120  
  2121  Scene VI.
  2122  Friar Laurence's cell.
  2123  
  2124  Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.
  2125  
  2126  
  2127    Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
  2128      That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
  2129  
  2130    Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
  2131      It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
  2132      That one short minute gives me in her sight.
  2133      Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
  2134      Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
  2135      It is enough I may but call her mine.
  2136  
  2137    Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
  2138      And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
  2139      Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
  2140      Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
  2141      And in the taste confounds the appetite.
  2142      Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
  2143      Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
  2144  
  2145                       Enter Juliet.
  2146  
  2147      Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
  2148      Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
  2149      A lover may bestride the gossamer
  2150      That idles in the wanton summer air,
  2151      And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
  2152  
  2153    Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
  2154  
  2155    Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
  2156  
  2157    Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
  2158  
  2159    Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
  2160      Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
  2161      To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
  2162      This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
  2163      Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
  2164      Receive in either by this dear encounter.
  2165  
  2166    Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
  2167      Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
  2168      They are but beggars that can count their worth;
  2169      But my true love is grown to such excess
  2170      cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
  2171  
  2172    Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
  2173      For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
  2174      Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
  2175                                                         [Exeunt.]

  2179  
  2180  ACT III. Scene I.
  2181  A public place.
  2182  
  2183  Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.
  2184  
  2185  
  2186    Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
  2187      The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
  2188      And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
  2189      For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
  2190  
  2191    Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
  2192      the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
  2193      says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the
  2194      second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
  2195  
  2196    Ben. Am I like such a fellow?
  2197  
  2198    Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
  2199      Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
  2200      moved.
  2201  
  2202    Ben. And what to?
  2203  
  2204    Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
  2205      for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a
  2206      man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
  2207      Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
  2208      other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
  2209      eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
  2210      as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
  2211      addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a
  2212      man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
  2213      that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
  2214      tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
  2215      another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
  2216      tutor me from quarrelling!
  2217  
  2218    Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
  2219      buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
  2220  
  2221    Mer. The fee simple? O simple!
  2222  
  2223                         Enter Tybalt and others.
  2224  
  2225  
  2226    Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.
  2227  
  2228    Mer. By my heel, I care not.
  2229  
  2230    Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
  2231      Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
  2232  
  2233    Mer. And but one word with one of us?
  2234      Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
  2235  
  2236    Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
  2237      occasion.
  2238  
  2239    Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving
  2240  
  2241    Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
  2242  
  2243    Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
  2244      minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
  2245      fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
  2246  
  2247    Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
  2248      Either withdraw unto some private place
  2249      And reason coldly of your grievances,
  2250      Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
  2251  
  2252    Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
  2253      I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
  2254  
  2255                          Enter Romeo.
  2256  
  2257  
  2258    Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
  2259  
  2260    Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
  2261      Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
  2262      Your worship in that sense may call him man.
  2263  
  2264    Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
  2265      No better term than this: thou art a villain.
  2266  
  2267    Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
  2268      Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
  2269      To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
  2270      Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
  2271  
  2272    Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
  2273      That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
  2274  
  2275    Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
  2276      But love thee better than thou canst devise
  2277      Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
  2278      And so good Capulet, which name I tender
  2279      As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
  2280  
  2281    Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
  2282      Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
  2283      Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
  2284  
  2285    Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?
  2286  
  2287    Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
  2288  That I
  2289      mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,
  2290  
  2291      dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out
  2292      of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
  2293      ears ere it be out.
  2294  
  2295    Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
  2296  
  2297    Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
  2298  
  2299    Mer. Come, sir, your passado!
  2300                                                     [They fight.]
  2301  
  2302    Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
  2303      Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
  2304      Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
  2305      Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
  2306      Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
  2307           Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
  2308                                             [with his Followers].
  2309  
  2310    Mer. I am hurt.
  2311      A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
  2312      Is he gone and hath nothing?
  2313  
  2314    Ben. What, art thou hurt?
  2315  
  2316    Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
  2317      Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
  2318                                                      [Exit Page.]
  2319  
  2320    Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
  2321  
  2322    Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
  2323      but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
  2324      shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
  2325      world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
  2326      mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
  2327  a
  2328      villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
  2329      came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
  2330  
  2331    Rom. I thought all for the best.
  2332  
  2333    Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
  2334      Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
  2335      They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
  2336      And soundly too. Your houses!
  2337                                   [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].
  2338  
  2339    Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
  2340      My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
  2341      In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
  2342      With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
  2343      Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
  2344      Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
  2345      And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
  2346  
  2347                        Enter Benvolio.
  2348  
  2349  
  2350    Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
  2351      That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
  2352      Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
  2353  
  2354    Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
  2355      This but begins the woe others must end.
  2356  
  2357                         Enter Tybalt.
  2358  
  2359  
  2360    Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
  2361  
  2362    Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
  2363      Away to heaven respective lenity,
  2364      And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
  2365      Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
  2366      That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
  2367      Is but a little way above our heads,
  2368      Staying for thine to keep him company.
  2369      Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
  2370  
  2371    Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
  2372      Shalt with him hence.
  2373  
  2374    Rom. This shall determine that.
  2375                                         They fight. Tybalt falls.
  2376  
  2377    Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
  2378      The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
  2379      Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
  2380      If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
  2381  
  2382    Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
  2383  
  2384    Ben. Why dost thou stay?
  2385                                                       Exit Romeo.
  2386                        Enter Citizens.
  2387  
  2388  
  2389    Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
  2390      Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?
  2391  
  2392    Ben. There lies that Tybalt.
  2393  
  2394    Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
  2395      I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
  2396  
  2397  
  2398    Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
  2399                       and [others].
  2400  
  2401  
  2402    Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
  2403  
  2404    Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
  2405      The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
  2406      There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
  2407      That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
  2408  
  2409    Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
  2410      O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
  2411      Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
  2412      For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
  2413      O cousin, cousin!
  2414  
  2415    Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
  2416  
  2417    Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
  2418      Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
  2419      How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
  2420      Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
  2421      With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
  2422      Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
  2423      Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
  2424      With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
  2425      Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
  2426      And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
  2427      Cold death aside and with the other sends
  2428      It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
  2429      Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
  2430      'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
  2431      His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
  2432      And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
  2433      An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
  2434      Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
  2435      But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
  2436      Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
  2437      And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
  2438      Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
  2439      And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
  2440      This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
  2441  
  2442    Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
  2443      Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
  2444      Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
  2445      And all those twenty could but kill one life.
  2446      I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
  2447      Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
  2448  
  2449    Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
  2450      Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
  2451  
  2452    Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
  2453      His fault concludes but what the law should end,
  2454      The life of Tybalt.
  2455  
  2456    Prince. And for that offence
  2457      Immediately we do exile him hence.
  2458      I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
  2459      My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
  2460      But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
  2461      That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
  2462      I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
  2463      Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
  2464      Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
  2465      Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
  2466      Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
  2467      Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
  2468                                                           Exeunt.

  2473  Scene II.
  2474  Capulet's orchard.
  2475  
  2476  Enter Juliet alone.
  2477  
  2478  
  2479    Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
  2480      Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
  2481      As Phaeton would whip you to the West
  2482      And bring in cloudy night immediately.
  2483      Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
  2484      That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
  2485      Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
  2486      Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
  2487      By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
  2488      It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
  2489      Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
  2490      And learn me how to lose a winning match,
  2491      Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
  2492      Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
  2493      With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
  2494      Think true love acted simple modesty.
  2495      Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
  2496      For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
  2497      Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
  2498      Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
  2499      Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
  2500      Take him and cut him out in little stars,
  2501      And he will make the face of heaven so fine
  2502      That all the world will be in love with night
  2503      And pay no worship to the garish sun.
  2504      O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
  2505      But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
  2506      Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
  2507      As is the night before some festival
  2508      To an impatient child that hath new robes
  2509      And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
  2510  
  2511                  Enter Nurse, with cords.
  2512  
  2513      And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
  2514      But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
  2515      Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  2516      That Romeo bid thee fetch?
  2517  
  2518    Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
  2519                                               [Throws them down.]
  2520  
  2521    Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
  2522  
  2523    Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
  2524      We are undone, lady, we are undone!
  2525      Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
  2526  
  2527    Jul. Can heaven be so envious?
  2528  
  2529    Nurse. Romeo can,
  2530      Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
  2531      Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
  2532  
  2533    Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
  2534      This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
  2535      Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
  2536      And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
  2537      Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
  2538      I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
  2539      Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
  2540      If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
  2541      Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
  2542  
  2543    Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
  2544      (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
  2545      A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
  2546      Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
  2547      All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
  2548  
  2549    Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
  2550      To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
  2551      Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
  2552      And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
  2553  
  2554    Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  2555      O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
  2556      That ever I should live to see thee dead!
  2557  
  2558    Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
  2559      Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
  2560      My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
  2561      Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
  2562      For who is living, if those two are gone?
  2563  
  2564    Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
  2565      Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
  2566  
  2567    Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
  2568  
  2569    Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
  2570  
  2571    Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
  2572      Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  2573      Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
  2574      Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
  2575      Despised substance of divinest show!
  2576      Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
  2577      A damned saint, an honourable villain!
  2578      O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
  2579      When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
  2580      In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
  2581      Was ever book containing such vile matter
  2582      So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
  2583      In such a gorgeous palace!
  2584  
  2585    Nurse. There's no trust,
  2586      No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
  2587      All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
  2588      Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
  2589      These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
  2590      Shame come to Romeo!
  2591  
  2592    Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
  2593      For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
  2594      Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
  2595      For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
  2596      Sole monarch of the universal earth.
  2597      O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
  2598  
  2599    Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
  2600  
  2601    Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
  2602      Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
  2603      When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
  2604      But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
  2605      That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
  2606      Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
  2607      Your tributary drops belong to woe,
  2608      Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
  2609      My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
  2610      And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
  2611      All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
  2612      Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
  2613      That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
  2614      But O, it presses to my memory
  2615      Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
  2616      'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
  2617      That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
  2618      Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
  2619      Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
  2620      Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
  2621      And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
  2622      Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
  2623      Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
  2624      Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
  2625      But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
  2626      'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
  2627      Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
  2628      All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
  2629      There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
  2630      In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
  2631      Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
  2632  
  2633    Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
  2634      Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
  2635  
  2636    Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
  2637      When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
  2638      Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
  2639      Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
  2640      He made you for a highway to my bed;
  2641      But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
  2642      Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
  2643      And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
  2644  
  2645    Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
  2646      To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
  2647      Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
  2648      I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
  2649  
  2650    Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
  2651      And bid him come to take his last farewell.
  2652                                                           Exeunt.
  2653  
  2654  
  2655  
  2656  
  2657  Scene III.
  2658  Friar Laurence's cell.
  2659  
  2660  Enter Friar [Laurence].
  2661  
  2662  
  2663    Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
  2664      Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
  2665      And thou art wedded to calamity.
  2666  
  2667                           Enter Romeo.
  2668  
  2669  
  2670    Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
  2671      What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
  2672      That I yet know not?
  2673  
  2674    Friar. Too familiar
  2675      Is my dear son with such sour company.
  2676      I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
  2677  
  2678    Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
  2679  
  2680    Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
  2681      Not body's death, but body's banishment.
  2682  
  2683    Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
  2684      For exile hath more terror in his look,
  2685      Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'
  2686  
  2687    Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
  2688      Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
  2689  
  2690    Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
  2691      But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
  2692      Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
  2693      And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
  2694      Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
  2695      Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
  2696      And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
  2697  
  2698    Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
  2699      Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
  2700      Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
  2701      And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
  2702      This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
  2703  
  2704    Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
  2705      Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
  2706      And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
  2707      Live here in heaven and may look on her;
  2708      But Romeo may not. More validity,
  2709      More honourable state, more courtship lives
  2710      In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
  2711      On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
  2712      And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
  2713      Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
  2714      Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
  2715      But Romeo may not- he is banished.
  2716      This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
  2717      They are free men, but I am banished.
  2718      And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
  2719      Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
  2720      No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  2721      But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
  2722      O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
  2723      Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
  2724      Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
  2725      A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
  2726      To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
  2727  
  2728    Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
  2729  
  2730    Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
  2731  
  2732    Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
  2733      Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
  2734      To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
  2735  
  2736    Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
  2737      Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
  2738      Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
  2739      It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
  2740  
  2741    Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
  2742  
  2743    Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
  2744  
  2745    Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
  2746  
  2747    Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
  2748      Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
  2749      An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
  2750      Doting like me, and like me banished,
  2751      Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
  2752      And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
  2753      Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
  2754                                                   Knock [within].
  2755  
  2756    Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
  2757  
  2758    Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  2759      Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.
  2760  
  2761    Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
  2762      Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
  2763      Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
  2764      What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
  2765      Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
  2766  
  2767    Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
  2768      I come from Lady Juliet.
  2769  
  2770    Friar. Welcome then.
  2771  
  2772                         Enter Nurse.
  2773  
  2774  
  2775    Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
  2776      Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
  2777  
  2778    Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
  2779  
  2780    Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
  2781      Just in her case!
  2782  
  2783    Friar. O woeful sympathy!
  2784      Piteous predicament!
  2785  
  2786    Nurse. Even so lies she,
  2787      Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
  2788      Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
  2789      For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
  2790      Why should you fall into so deep an O?
  2791  
  2792    Rom. (rises) Nurse-
  2793  
  2794    Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
  2795  
  2796    Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
  2797      Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
  2798      Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
  2799      With blood remov'd but little from her own?
  2800      Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
  2801      My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
  2802  
  2803    Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
  2804      And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
  2805      And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
  2806      And then down falls again.
  2807  
  2808    Rom. As if that name,
  2809      Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
  2810      Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
  2811      Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
  2812      In what vile part of this anatomy
  2813      Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
  2814      The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]
  2815  
  2816    Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
  2817      Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
  2818      Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
  2819      The unreasonable fury of a beast.
  2820      Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
  2821      Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
  2822      Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
  2823      I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
  2824      Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
  2825      And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
  2826      By doing damned hate upon thyself?
  2827      Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
  2828      Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
  2829      In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
  2830      Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
  2831      Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
  2832      And usest none in that true use indeed
  2833      Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
  2834      Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
  2835      Digressing from the valour of a man;
  2836      Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
  2837      Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
  2838      Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
  2839      Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
  2840      Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
  2841      is get afire by thine own ignorance,
  2842      And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
  2843      What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
  2844      For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
  2845      There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
  2846      But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
  2847      The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
  2848      And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
  2849      A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
  2850      Happiness courts thee in her best array;
  2851      But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
  2852      Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
  2853      Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
  2854      Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
  2855      Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
  2856      But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
  2857      For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
  2858      Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
  2859      To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
  2860      Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
  2861      With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
  2862      Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
  2863      Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
  2864      And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
  2865      Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
  2866      Romeo is coming.
  2867  
  2868    Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
  2869      To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
  2870      My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
  2871  
  2872    Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
  2873  
  2874    Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
  2875      Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.
  2876  
  2877    Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
  2878  
  2879    Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
  2880      Either be gone before the watch be set,
  2881      Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
  2882      Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
  2883      And he shall signify from time to time
  2884      Every good hap to you that chances here.
  2885      Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.
  2886  
  2887    Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
  2888      It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
  2889      Farewell.
  2890                                                           Exeunt.

  2894  
  2895  Scene IV.
  2896  Capulet's house
  2897  
  2898  Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.
  2899  
  2900  
  2901    Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
  2902      That we have had no time to move our daughter.
  2903      Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
  2904      And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
  2905      'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
  2906      I promise you, but for your company,
  2907      I would have been abed an hour ago.
  2908  
  2909    Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
  2910      Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
  2911  
  2912    Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
  2913      To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
  2914  
  2915    Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
  2916      Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
  2917      In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
  2918      Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
  2919      Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
  2920      And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
  2921      But, soft! what day is this?
  2922  
  2923    Par. Monday, my lord.
  2924  
  2925    Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
  2926      Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
  2927      She shall be married to this noble earl.
  2928      Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
  2929      We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
  2930      For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
  2931      It may be thought we held him carelessly,
  2932      Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
  2933      Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
  2934      And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
  2935  
  2936    Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
  2937  
  2938    Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
  2939      Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
  2940      Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
  2941      Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
  2942      Afore me, It is so very very late
  2943      That we may call it early by-and-by.
  2944      Good night.
  2945                                                            Exeunt
  2946  
  2947  
  2948  
  2949  
  2950  Scene V.
  2951  Capulet's orchard.
  2952  
  2953  Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.
  2954  
  2955  
  2956    Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
  2957      It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
  2958      That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
  2959      Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
  2960      Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
  2961  
  2962    Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
  2963      No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
  2964      Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
  2965      Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
  2966      Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
  2967      I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
  2968  
  2969    Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
  2970      It is some meteor that the sun exhales
  2971      To be to thee this night a torchbearer
  2972      And light thee on the way to Mantua.
  2973      Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
  2974  
  2975    Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
  2976      I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
  2977      I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
  2978      'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
  2979      Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
  2980      The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
  2981      I have more care to stay than will to go.
  2982      Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
  2983      How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
  2984  
  2985    Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
  2986      It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
  2987      Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
  2988      Some say the lark makes sweet division;
  2989      This doth not so, for she divideth us.
  2990      Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
  2991      O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
  2992      Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
  2993      Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
  2994      O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
  2995  
  2996    Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
  2997  
  2998                            Enter Nurse.
  2999  
  3000  
  3001    Nurse. Madam!
  3002  
  3003    Jul. Nurse?
  3004  
  3005    Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
  3006      The day is broke; be wary, look about.
  3007  
  3008    Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
  3009                                                           [Exit.]
  3010  
  3011    Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
  3012                                                    He goeth down.
  3013  
  3014    Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
  3015      I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
  3016      For in a minute there are many days.
  3017      O, by this count I shall be much in years
  3018      Ere I again behold my Romeo!
  3019  
  3020    Rom. Farewell!
  3021      I will omit no opportunity
  3022      That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
  3023  
  3024    Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
  3025  
  3026    Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  3027      For sweet discourses in our time to come.
  3028  
  3029    Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
  3030      Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
  3031      As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
  3032      Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  3033  
  3034    Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
  3035      Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
  3036  Exit.
  3037  
  3038    Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
  3039      If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
  3040      That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
  3041      For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
  3042      But send him back.
  3043  
  3044    Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
  3045  
  3046    Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
  3047      Is she not down so late, or up so early?
  3048      What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
  3049  
  3050                         Enter Mother.
  3051  
  3052  
  3053    Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
  3054  
  3055    Jul. Madam, I am not well.
  3056  
  3057    Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  3058      What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
  3059      An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
  3060      Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
  3061      But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
  3062  
  3063    Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
  3064  
  3065    Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
  3066      Which you weep for.
  3067  
  3068    Jul. Feeling so the loss,
  3069      I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
  3070  
  3071    Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
  3072      As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
  3073  
  3074    Jul. What villain, madam?
  3075  
  3076    Lady. That same villain Romeo.
  3077  
  3078    Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
  3079      God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
  3080      And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
  3081  
  3082    Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
  3083  
  3084    Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
  3085      Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
  3086  
  3087    Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
  3088      Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
  3089      Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
  3090      Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
  3091      That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
  3092      And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
  3093  
  3094    Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
  3095      With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
  3096      Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
  3097      Madam, if you could find out but a man
  3098      To bear a poison, I would temper it;
  3099      That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
  3100      Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
  3101      To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
  3102      To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
  3103      Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
  3104  
  3105    Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
  3106      But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
  3107  
  3108    Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
  3109      What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
  3110  
  3111    Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
  3112      One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
  3113      Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
  3114      That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.
  3115  
  3116    Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
  3117  
  3118    Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
  3119      The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
  3120      The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
  3121      Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
  3122  
  3123    Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
  3124      He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
  3125      I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
  3126      Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
  3127      I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
  3128      I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
  3129      It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
  3130      Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
  3131  
  3132    Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
  3133      And see how be will take it at your hands.
  3134  
  3135                     Enter Capulet and Nurse.
  3136  
  3137  
  3138    Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
  3139      But for the sunset of my brother's son
  3140      It rains downright.
  3141      How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
  3142      Evermore show'ring? In one little body
  3143      Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
  3144      For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
  3145      Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
  3146      Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
  3147      Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
  3148      Without a sudden calm will overset
  3149      Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
  3150      Have you delivered to her our decree?
  3151  
  3152    Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
  3153      I would the fool were married to her grave!
  3154  
  3155    Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
  3156      How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
  3157      Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
  3158      Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  3159      So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
  3160  
  3161    Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
  3162      Proud can I never be of what I hate,
  3163      But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
  3164  
  3165    Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
  3166      'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-
  3167      And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
  3168      Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
  3169      But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
  3170      To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
  3171      Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
  3172      Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
  3173      You tallow-face!
  3174  
  3175    Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
  3176  
  3177    Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
  3178      Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
  3179  
  3180    Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
  3181      I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
  3182      Or never after look me in the face.
  3183      Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
  3184      My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
  3185      That God had lent us but this only child;
  3186      But now I see this one is one too much,
  3187      And that we have a curse in having her.
  3188      Out on her, hilding!
  3189  
  3190    Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
  3191      You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
  3192  
  3193    Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
  3194      Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!
  3195  
  3196    Nurse. I speak no treason.
  3197  
  3198    Cap. O, God-i-god-en!
  3199  
  3200    Nurse. May not one speak?
  3201  
  3202    Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
  3203      Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
  3204      For here we need it not.
  3205  
  3206    Lady. You are too hot.
  3207  
  3208    Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
  3209      At home, abroad, alone, in company,
  3210      Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
  3211      To have her match'd; and having now provided
  3212      A gentleman of princely parentage,
  3213      Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
  3214      Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  3215      Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
  3216      And then to have a wretched puling fool,
  3217      A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
  3218      To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
  3219      I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
  3220      But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
  3221      Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
  3222      Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
  3223      Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
  3224      An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
  3225      An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
  3226      For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
  3227      Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
  3228      Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.
  3229  
  3230    Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
  3231      That sees into the bottom of my grief?
  3232      O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
  3233      Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
  3234      Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
  3235      In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
  3236  
  3237    Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
  3238      Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.
  3239  
  3240    Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
  3241      My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
  3242      How shall that faith return again to earth
  3243      Unless that husband send it me from heaven
  3244      By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
  3245      Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
  3246      Upon so soft a subject as myself!
  3247      What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
  3248      Some comfort, nurse.
  3249  
  3250    Nurse. Faith, here it is.
  3251      Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
  3252      That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
  3253      Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  3254      Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
  3255      I think it best you married with the County.
  3256      O, he's a lovely gentleman!
  3257      Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
  3258      Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
  3259      As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
  3260      I think you are happy in this second match,
  3261      For it excels your first; or if it did not,
  3262      Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
  3263      As living here and you no use of him.
  3264  
  3265    Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
  3266  
  3267    Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
  3268  
  3269    Jul. Amen!
  3270  
  3271    Nurse. What?
  3272  
  3273    Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
  3274      Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
  3275      Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
  3276      To make confession and to be absolv'd.
  3277  
  3278    Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.
  3279  
  3280    Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
  3281      Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
  3282      Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
  3283      Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
  3284      So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
  3285      Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
  3286      I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
  3287      If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.
  3288  
  3289  
  3290  
  3291  
  3292  ACT IV. Scene I.
  3293  Friar Laurence's cell.
  3294  
  3295  Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.
  3296  
  3297  
  3298    Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
  3299  
  3300    Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
  3301      And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
  3302  
  3303    Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
  3304      Uneven is the course; I like it not.
  3305  
  3306    Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
  3307      And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
  3308      For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
  3309      Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
  3310      That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
  3311      And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
  3312      To stop the inundation of her tears,
  3313      Which, too much minded by herself alone,
  3314      May be put from her by society.
  3315      Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  3316  
  3317    Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
  3318      Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
  3319  
  3320                      Enter Juliet.
  3321  
  3322  
  3323    Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
  3324  
  3325    Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
  3326  
  3327    Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
  3328  
  3329    Jul. What must be shall be.
  3330  
  3331    Friar. That's a certain text.
  3332  
  3333    Par. Come you to make confession to this father?
  3334  
  3335    Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
  3336  
  3337    Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
  3338  
  3339    Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
  3340  
  3341    Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
  3342  
  3343    Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
  3344      Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
  3345  
  3346    Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
  3347  
  3348    Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
  3349      For it was bad enough before their spite.
  3350  
  3351    Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
  3352  
  3353    Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
  3354      And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
  3355  
  3356    Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
  3357  
  3358    Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
  3359      Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
  3360      Or shall I come to you at evening mass
  3361  
  3362    Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
  3363      My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
  3364  
  3365    Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
  3366      Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
  3367      Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.
  3368  
  3369    Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
  3370      Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!
  3371  
  3372    Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
  3373      It strains me past the compass of my wits.
  3374      I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
  3375      On Thursday next be married to this County.
  3376  
  3377    Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
  3378      Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
  3379      If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
  3380      Do thou but call my resolution wise
  3381      And with this knife I'll help it presently.
  3382      God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
  3383      And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
  3384      Shall be the label to another deed,
  3385      Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
  3386      Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
  3387      Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
  3388      Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
  3389      'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
  3390      Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
  3391      Which the commission of thy years and art
  3392      Could to no issue of true honour bring.
  3393      Be not so long to speak. I long to die
  3394      If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
  3395  
  3396    Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
  3397      Which craves as desperate an execution
  3398      As that is desperate which we would prevent.
  3399      If, rather than to marry County Paris
  3400      Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
  3401      Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
  3402      A thing like death to chide away this shame,
  3403      That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
  3404      And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
  3405  
  3406    Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
  3407      From off the battlements of yonder tower,
  3408      Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
  3409      Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
  3410      Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
  3411      O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
  3412      With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
  3413      Or bid me go into a new-made grave
  3414      And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
  3415      Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
  3416      And I will do it without fear or doubt,
  3417      To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
  3418  
  3419    Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
  3420      To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
  3421      To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
  3422      Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
  3423      Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
  3424      And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
  3425      When presently through all thy veins shall run
  3426      A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
  3427      Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
  3428      No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
  3429      The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
  3430      To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
  3431      Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
  3432      Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
  3433      Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
  3434      And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
  3435      Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
  3436      And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
  3437      Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
  3438      To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
  3439      Then, as the manner of our country is,
  3440      In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
  3441      Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
  3442      Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
  3443      In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
  3444      Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
  3445      And hither shall he come; and he and I
  3446      Will watch thy waking, and that very night
  3447      Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
  3448      And this shall free thee from this present shame,
  3449      If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
  3450      Abate thy valour in the acting it.
  3451  
  3452    Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
  3453  
  3454    Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
  3455      In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
  3456      To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
  3457  
  3458    Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  3459      Farewell, dear father.
  3460                                                           Exeunt.
  3461  
  3462  
  3463  
  3464  
  3465  Scene II.
  3466  Capulet's house.
  3467  
  3468  Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
  3469                          two or three.
  3470  
  3471  
  3472    Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
  3473                                              [Exit a Servingman.]
  3474      Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
  3475  
  3476    Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
  3477      lick their fingers.
  3478  
  3479    Cap. How canst thou try them so?
  3480  
  3481    Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
  3482      fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
  3483      with me.
  3484  
  3485    Cap. Go, begone.
  3486                                                  Exit Servingman.
  3487      We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
  3488      What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
  3489  
  3490    Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
  3491  
  3492    Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
  3493      A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
  3494  
  3495                          Enter Juliet.
  3496  
  3497  
  3498    Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
  3499  
  3500    Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
  3501  
  3502    Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
  3503      Of disobedient opposition
  3504      To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
  3505      By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
  3506      To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
  3507      Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
  3508  
  3509    Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
  3510      I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
  3511  
  3512    Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
  3513      And gave him what becomed love I might,
  3514      Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
  3515  
  3516    Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
  3517      This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
  3518      Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
  3519      Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
  3520      All our whole city is much bound to him.
  3521  
  3522    Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
  3523      To help me sort such needful ornaments
  3524      As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
  3525  
  3526    Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
  3527  
  3528    Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
  3529                                          Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
  3530  
  3531    Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
  3532      'Tis now near night.
  3533  
  3534    Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
  3535      And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
  3536      Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
  3537      I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
  3538      I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
  3539      They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
  3540      To County Paris, to prepare him up
  3541      Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
  3542      Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
  3543                                                           Exeunt.

  3549  Juliet's chamber.
  3550  
  3551  Enter Juliet and Nurse.

  3554    Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
  3555      I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
  3556      For I have need of many orisons
  3557      To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
  3558      Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
  3559  
  3560                            Enter Mother.
  3561  
  3562  
  3563    Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
  3564  
  3565    Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
  3566      As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
  3567      So please you, let me now be left alone,
  3568      And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
  3569      For I am sure you have your hands full all
  3570      In this so sudden business.
  3571  
  3572    Mother. Good night.
  3573      Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
  3574                                        Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]
  3575  
  3576    Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
  3577      I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
  3578      That almost freezes up the heat of life.
  3579      I'll call them back again to comfort me.
  3580      Nurse!- What should she do here?
  3581      My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
  3582      Come, vial.
  3583      What if this mixture do not work at all?
  3584      Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
  3585      No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
  3586                                               Lays down a dagger.
  3587      What if it be a poison which the friar
  3588      Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
  3589      Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
  3590      Because he married me before to Romeo?
  3591      I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
  3592      For he hath still been tried a holy man.
  3593      I will not entertain so bad a thought.
  3594      How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
  3595      I wake before the time that Romeo
  3596      Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
  3597      Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
  3598      To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
  3599      And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
  3600      Or, if I live, is it not very like
  3601      The horrible conceit of death and night,
  3602      Together with the terror of the place-
  3603      As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
  3604      Where for this many hundred years the bones
  3605      Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
  3606      Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
  3607      Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
  3608      At some hours in the night spirits resort-
  3609      Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
  3610      So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
  3611      And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
  3612      That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
  3613      O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
  3614      Environed with all these hideous fears,
  3615      And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
  3616      And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
  3617      And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
  3618      As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
  3619      O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  3620      Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
  3621      Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
  3622      Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
  3623  
  3624          She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.
  3625  
  3626

  3629  Scene IV.
  3630  Capulet's house.
  3631  
  3632  Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.
  3633  
  3634  
  3635    Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
  3636  
  3637    Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
  3638  
  3639                         Enter Old Capulet.
  3640  
  3641  
  3642    Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
  3643      The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
  3644      Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
  3645      Spare not for cost.
  3646  
  3647    Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
  3648      Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
  3649      For this night's watching.
  3650  
  3651    Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
  3652      All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  3653  
  3654    Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
  3655      But I will watch you from such watching now.
  3656                                            Exeunt Lady and Nurse.
  3657  
  3658    Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
  3659  
  3660  
  3661    Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.
  3662  
  3663      What is there? Now, fellow,
  3664  
  3665    Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
  3666  
  3667    Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
  3668        logs.
  3669      Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
  3670  
  3671    Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
  3672      And never trouble Peter for the matter.
  3673  
  3674    Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
  3675      Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
  3676      The County will be here with music straight,
  3677      For so he said he would.                         Play music.
  3678      I hear him near.
  3679      Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
  3680  
  3681                                Enter Nurse.
  3682      Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
  3683      I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
  3684      Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
  3685      Make haste, I say.
  3686                                                         [Exeunt.]

  3691  Scene V.
  3692  Juliet's chamber.
  3693  
  3694  [Enter Nurse.]
  3695  
  3696  
  3697    Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
  3698      Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
  3699      Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
  3700      What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
  3701      Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
  3702      The County Paris hath set up his rest
  3703      That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
  3704      Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
  3705      I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
  3706      Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
  3707      He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
  3708                                       [Draws aside the curtains.]
  3709      What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
  3710      I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
  3711      Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
  3712      O weraday that ever I was born!
  3713      Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
  3714  
  3715                             Enter Mother.
  3716  
  3717  
  3718    Mother. What noise is here?
  3719  
  3720    Nurse. O lamentable day!
  3721  
  3722    Mother. What is the matter?
  3723  
  3724    Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
  3725  
  3726    Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
  3727      Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
  3728      Help, help! Call help.
  3729  
  3730                              Enter Father.
  3731  
  3732  
  3733    Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
  3734  
  3735    Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
  3736  
  3737    Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
  3738  
  3739    Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
  3740      Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
  3741      Life and these lips have long been separated.
  3742      Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  3743      Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
  3744  
  3745    Nurse. O lamentable day!
  3746  
  3747    Mother. O woful time!
  3748  
  3749    Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
  3750      Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
  3751  
  3752  
  3753    Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
  3754  
  3755  
  3756    Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
  3757  
  3758    Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
  3759      O son, the night before thy wedding day
  3760      Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
  3761      Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
  3762      Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
  3763      My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
  3764      And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
  3765  
  3766    Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
  3767      And doth it give me such a sight as this?
  3768  
  3769    Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
  3770      Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
  3771      In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
  3772      But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
  3773      But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
  3774      And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
  3775  
  3776    Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
  3777      Most lamentable day, most woful day
  3778      That ever ever I did yet behold!
  3779      O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
  3780      Never was seen so black a day as this.
  3781      O woful day! O woful day!
  3782  
  3783    Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
  3784      Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
  3785      By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
  3786      O love! O life! not life, but love in death
  3787  
  3788    Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
  3789      Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
  3790      To murther, murther our solemnity?
  3791      O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
  3792      Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
  3793      And with my child my joys are buried!
  3794  
  3795    Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
  3796      In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
  3797      Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
  3798      And all the better is it for the maid.
  3799      Your part in her you could not keep from death,
  3800      But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
  3801      The most you sought was her promotion,
  3802      For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
  3803      And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
  3804      Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
  3805      O, in this love, you love your child so ill
  3806      That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
  3807      She's not well married that lives married long,
  3808      But she's best married that dies married young.
  3809      Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
  3810      On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
  3811      In all her best array bear her to church;
  3812      For though fond nature bids us all lament,
  3813      Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
  3814  
  3815    Cap. All things that we ordained festival
  3816      Turn from their office to black funeral-
  3817      Our instruments to melancholy bells,
  3818      Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
  3819      Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
  3820      Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
  3821      And all things change them to the contrary.
  3822  
  3823    Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
  3824      And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
  3825      To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
  3826      The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
  3827      Move them no more by crossing their high will.
  3828                             Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
  3829    1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
  3830  
  3831    Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
  3832      For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]
  3833    1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
  3834  
  3835                           Enter Peter.
  3836  
  3837  
  3838    Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
  3839      O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
  3840    1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',
  3841  
  3842    Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
  3843      full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
  3844    1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.
  3845  
  3846    Pet. You will not then?
  3847    1. Mus. No.
  3848  
  3849    Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
  3850    1. Mus. What will you give us?
  3851  
  3852    Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
  3853       minstrel.
  3854    1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.
  3855  
  3856    Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
  3857      I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
  3858      note me?
  3859    1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
  3860    2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
  3861  
  3862    Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
  3863      iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
  3864  
  3865             'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
  3866               And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
  3867             Then music with her silver sound'-
  3868  
  3869      Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
  3870      What say you, Simon Catling?
  3871    1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
  3872  
  3873    Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
  3874    2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
  3875  
  3876    Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
  3877    3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.
  3878  
  3879    Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
  3880      is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
  3881      gold for sounding.
  3882  
  3883             'Then music with her silver sound
  3884               With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.
  3885  
  3886    1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
  3887    2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the
  3888      mourners, and stay dinner.
  3889                                                           Exeunt.

  3894  ACT V. Scene I.
  3895  Mantua. A street.
  3896  
  3897  Enter Romeo.
  3898  
  3899  
  3900    Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
  3901      My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
  3902      My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
  3903      And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
  3904      Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
  3905      I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
  3906      (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
  3907      And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
  3908      That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
  3909      Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
  3910      When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
  3911  
  3912                  Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.
  3913  
  3914      News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
  3915      Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
  3916      How doth my lady? Is my father well?
  3917      How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
  3918      For nothing can be ill if she be well.
  3919  
  3920    Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
  3921      Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
  3922      And her immortal part with angels lives.
  3923      I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
  3924      And presently took post to tell it you.
  3925      O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
  3926      Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
  3927  
  3928    Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
  3929      Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
  3930      And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
  3931  
  3932    Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
  3933      Your looks are pale and wild and do import
  3934      Some misadventure.
  3935  
  3936    Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
  3937      Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
  3938      Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
  3939  
  3940    Man. No, my good lord.
  3941  
  3942    Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
  3943      And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
  3944                                                 Exit [Balthasar].
  3945      Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
  3946      Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
  3947      To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
  3948      I do remember an apothecary,
  3949      And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
  3950      In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
  3951      Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
  3952      Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
  3953      And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
  3954      An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
  3955      Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  3956      A beggarly account of empty boxes,
  3957      Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
  3958      Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
  3959      Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
  3960      Noting this penury, to myself I said,
  3961      'An if a man did need a poison now
  3962      Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
  3963      Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
  3964      O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
  3965      And this same needy man must sell it me.
  3966      As I remember, this should be the house.
  3967      Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!
  3968  
  3969                          Enter Apothecary.
  3970  
  3971  
  3972    Apoth. Who calls so loud?
  3973  
  3974    Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
  3975      Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
  3976      A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
  3977      As will disperse itself through all the veins
  3978      That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
  3979      And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
  3980      As violently as hasty powder fir'd
  3981      Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
  3982  
  3983    Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
  3984      Is death to any he that utters them.
  3985  
  3986    Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
  3987      And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
  3988      Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
  3989      Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
  3990      The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
  3991      The world affords no law to make thee rich;
  3992      Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
  3993  
  3994    Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.
  3995  
  3996    Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
  3997  
  3998    Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
  3999      And drink it off, and if you had the strength
  4000      Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
  4001  
  4002    Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
  4003      Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
  4004      Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
  4005      I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
  4006      Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
  4007      Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
  4008      To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
  4009                                                           Exeunt.
  4010

  4012  
  4013  
  4014  Scene II.
  4015  Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.
  4016  
  4017  Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.
  4018  
  4019  
  4020    John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
  4021  
  4022                        Enter Friar Laurence.
  4023  
  4024  
  4025    Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
  4026      Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
  4027      Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
  4028  
  4029    John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
  4030      One of our order, to associate me
  4031      Here in this city visiting the sick,
  4032      And finding him, the searchers of the town,
  4033      Suspecting that we both were in a house
  4034      Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
  4035      Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
  4036      So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
  4037  
  4038    Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
  4039  
  4040    John. I could not send it- here it is again-
  4041      Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
  4042      So fearful were they of infection.
  4043  
  4044    Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
  4045      The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
  4046      Of dear import; and the neglecting it
  4047      May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
  4048      Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
  4049      Unto my cell.
  4050  
  4051    John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
  4052  
  4053    Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
  4054      Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
  4055      She will beshrew me much that Romeo
  4056      Hath had no notice of these accidents;
  4057      But I will write again to Mantua,
  4058      And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
  4059      Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.
  4060  
  4061  
  4062  
  4063  
  4064  Scene III.
  4065  Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.
  4066  
  4067  Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].
  4068  
  4069  
  4070    Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
  4071      Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
  4072      Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
  4073      Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
  4074      So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
  4075      (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
  4076      But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
  4077      As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
  4078      Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
  4079  
  4080    Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
  4081      Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]
  4082  
  4083    Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
  4084      (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
  4085      Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
  4086      Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
  4087      The obsequies that I for thee will keep
  4088      Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
  4089                                                      Whistle Boy.
  4090      The boy gives warning something doth approach.
  4091      What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
  4092      To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
  4093      What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]
  4094  
  4095         Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
  4096                      and a crow of iron.
  4097  
  4098  
  4099    Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
  4100      Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
  4101      See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
  4102      Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
  4103      Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
  4104      And do not interrupt me in my course.
  4105      Why I descend into this bed of death
  4106      Is partly to behold my lady's face,
  4107      But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
  4108      A precious ring- a ring that I must use
  4109      In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
  4110      But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
  4111      In what I farther shall intend to do,
  4112      By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
  4113      And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
  4114      The time and my intents are savage-wild,
  4115      More fierce and more inexorable far
  4116      Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
  4117  
  4118    Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
  4119  
  4120    Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
  4121      Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
  4122  
  4123    Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
  4124      His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]
  4125  
  4126    Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
  4127      Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
  4128      Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
  4129      And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
  4130                                             Romeo opens the tomb.
  4131  
  4132    Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
  4133      That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
  4134      It is supposed the fair creature died-
  4135      And here is come to do some villanous shame
  4136      To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
  4137      Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
  4138      Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
  4139      Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
  4140      Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
  4141  
  4142    Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
  4143      Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
  4144      Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
  4145      Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
  4146      But not another sin upon my head
  4147      By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
  4148      By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
  4149      For I come hither arm'd against myself.
  4150      Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
  4151      A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
  4152  
  4153    Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
  4154      And apprehend thee for a felon here.
  4155  
  4156    Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
  4157                                                       They fight.
  4158  
  4159    Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
  4160                                              [Exit. Paris falls.]
  4161  
  4162    Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
  4163      Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
  4164  
  4165    Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
  4166      Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
  4167      What said my man when my betossed soul
  4168      Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  4169      He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
  4170      Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
  4171      Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
  4172      To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
  4173      One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
  4174      I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
  4175      A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
  4176      For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
  4177      This vault a feasting presence full of light.
  4178      Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
  4179                                           [Lays him in the tomb.]
  4180      How oft when men are at the point of death
  4181      Have they been merry! which their keepers call
  4182      A lightning before death. O, how may I
  4183      Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
  4184      Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
  4185      Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
  4186      Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
  4187      Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
  4188      And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
  4189      Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
  4190      O, what more favour can I do to thee
  4191      Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
  4192      To sunder his that was thine enemy?
  4193      Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
  4194      Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
  4195      That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
  4196      And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
  4197      Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
  4198      For fear of that I still will stay with thee
  4199      And never from this palace of dim night
  4200      Depart again. Here, here will I remain
  4201      With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
  4202      Will I set up my everlasting rest
  4203      And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
  4204      From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
  4205      Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
  4206      The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
  4207      A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
  4208      Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
  4209      Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
  4210      The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
  4211      Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
  4212      Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
  4213  
  4214      Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.
  4215  
  4216  
  4217    Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
  4218      Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
  4219  
  4220    Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
  4221  
  4222    Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
  4223      What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
  4224      To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
  4225      It burneth in the Capels' monument.
  4226  
  4227    Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
  4228      One that you love.
  4229  
  4230    Friar. Who is it?
  4231  
  4232    Bal. Romeo.
  4233  
  4234    Friar. How long hath he been there?
  4235  
  4236    Bal. Full half an hour.
  4237  
  4238    Friar. Go with me to the vault.
  4239  
  4240    Bal. I dare not, sir.
  4241      My master knows not but I am gone hence,
  4242      And fearfully did menace me with death
  4243      If I did stay to look on his intents.
  4244  
  4245    Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
  4246      O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
  4247  
  4248    Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
  4249      I dreamt my master and another fought,
  4250      And that my master slew him.
  4251  
  4252    Friar. Romeo!
  4253      Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
  4254      The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
  4255      What mean these masterless and gory swords
  4256      To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
  4257      Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
  4258      And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
  4259      Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
  4260                                                     Juliet rises.
  4261  
  4262    Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
  4263      I do remember well where I should be,
  4264      And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
  4265  
  4266    Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
  4267      Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
  4268      A greater power than we can contradict
  4269      Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
  4270      Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
  4271      And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
  4272      Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
  4273      Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
  4274      Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
  4275  
  4276    Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
  4277                                                     Exit [Friar].
  4278      What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
  4279      Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
  4280      O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  4281      To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
  4282      Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
  4283      To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
  4284      Thy lips are warm!
  4285  
  4286    Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
  4287      Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
  4288                                        [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
  4289      This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
  4290                    She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
  4291  
  4292                  Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.
  4293  
  4294  
  4295    Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
  4296  
  4297    Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
  4298      Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
  4299                                       [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
  4300      Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
  4301      And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
  4302      Who here hath lain this two days buried.
  4303      Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
  4304      Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
  4305                                     [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
  4306      We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
  4307      But the true ground of all these piteous woes
  4308      We cannot without circumstance descry.
  4309  
  4310       Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
  4311  
  4312    2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
  4313  
  4314    Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
  4315  
  4316            Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.
  4317  
  4318    3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
  4319      We took this mattock and this spade from him
  4320      As he was coming from this churchyard side.
  4321  
  4322    Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.
  4323  
  4324                Enter the Prince [and Attendants].
  4325  
  4326  
  4327    Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
  4328      That calls our person from our morning rest?
  4329  
  4330              Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].
  4331  
  4332  
  4333    Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
  4334  
  4335    Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
  4336      Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
  4337      With open outcry, toward our monument.
  4338  
  4339    Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?
  4340  
  4341    Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
  4342      And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
  4343      Warm and new kill'd.
  4344  
  4345    Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
  4346  
  4347    Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
  4348      With instruments upon them fit to open
  4349      These dead men's tombs.
  4350  
  4351    Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
  4352      This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
  4353      Is empty on the back of Montague,
  4354      And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
  4355  
  4356    Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
  4357      That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
  4358  
  4359                 Enter Montague [and others].
  4360  
  4361  
  4362    Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
  4363      To see thy son and heir more early down.
  4364  
  4365    Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
  4366      Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
  4367      What further woe conspires against mine age?
  4368  
  4369    Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.
  4370  
  4371    Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
  4372      To press before thy father to a grave?
  4373  
  4374    Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
  4375      Till we can clear these ambiguities
  4376      And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
  4377      And then will I be general of your woes
  4378      And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
  4379      And let mischance be slave to patience.
  4380      Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
  4381  
  4382    Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
  4383      Yet most suspected, as the time and place
  4384      Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
  4385      And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
  4386      Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
  4387  
  4388    Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
  4389  
  4390    Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  4391      Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
  4392      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
  4393      And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
  4394      I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
  4395      Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
  4396      Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
  4397      For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
  4398      You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
  4399      Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
  4400      To County Paris. Then comes she to me
  4401      And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
  4402      To rid her from this second marriage,
  4403      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
  4404      Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
  4405      A sleeping potion; which so took effect
  4406      As I intended, for it wrought on her
  4407      The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
  4408      That he should hither come as this dire night
  4409      To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
  4410      Being the time the potion's force should cease.
  4411      But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
  4412      Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
  4413      Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  4414      At the prefixed hour of her waking
  4415      Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
  4416      Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
  4417      Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
  4418      But when I came, some minute ere the time
  4419      Of her awaking, here untimely lay
  4420      The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
  4421      She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
  4422      And bear this work of heaven with patience;
  4423      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
  4424      And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
  4425      But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
  4426      All this I know, and to the marriage
  4427      Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
  4428      Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
  4429      Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
  4430      Unto the rigour of severest law.
  4431  
  4432    Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
  4433      Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
  4434  
  4435    Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
  4436      And then in post he came from Mantua
  4437      To this same place, to this same monument.
  4438      This letter he early bid me give his father,
  4439      And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
  4440      If I departed not and left him there.
  4441  
  4442    Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
  4443      Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
  4444      Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
  4445  
  4446    Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
  4447      And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
  4448      Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
  4449      And by-and-by my master drew on him;
  4450      And then I ran away to call the watch.
  4451  
  4452    Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
  4453      Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
  4454      And here he writes that he did buy a poison
  4455      Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
  4456      Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
  4457      Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
  4458      See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
  4459      That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
  4460      And I, for winking at you, discords too,
  4461      Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
  4462  
  4463    Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
  4464      This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
  4465      Can I demand.
  4466  
  4467    Mon. But I can give thee more;
  4468      For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
  4469      That whiles Verona by that name is known,
  4470      There shall no figure at such rate be set
  4471      As that of true and faithful Juliet.
  4472  
  4473    Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
  4474      Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
  4475  
  4476    Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
  4477      The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
  4478      Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  4479      Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
  4480      For never was a story of more woe
  4481      Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
  4482                                                     Exeunt omnes.

  4552  1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
  4553  used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
  4554  agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
  4555  things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
  4556  even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
  4557  paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
  4558  Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

  4560  works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

  4562  1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
  4563  or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
  4564  Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
  4565  collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
  4566  individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
  4567  located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
  4568  copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
  4569  works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
  4570  are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
  4571  Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
  4572  freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
  4573  this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
  4574  the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
  4575  keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
  4576  Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
  4577  
  4578  1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
  4579  what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
  4580  a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
  4581  the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
  4582  before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
  4583  creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
  4584  Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
  4585  the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
  4586  States.

  4604  posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
  4605  and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
  4606  or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
  4607  with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

  4651       the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  4652       you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
  4653       owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
  4654       has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
  4655       Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
  4656       must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

  4674       of receipt of the work.
  4675  
  4676  - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  4677       distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

  4687  
  4688  1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
  4689  effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
  4690  public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
  4691  collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
  4692  works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
  4693  "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
  4694  corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
  4695  property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
  4696  computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

  4703  Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
  4704  liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
  4705  fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
  4706  LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
  4707  PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
  4708  TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
  4709  LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
  4710  INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  4711  DAMAGE.
  4712  
  4713  1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
  4714  defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
  4715  receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
  4716  written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
  4717  received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
  4718  your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
  4719  the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
  4720  refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
  4721  providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
  4722  receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
  4723  is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
  4724  opportunities to fix the problem.

  4731  1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
  4732  warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
  4733  If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
  4734  law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
  4735  interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
  4736  the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
  4737  provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
  4738  
  4739  1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
  4740  trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

  4743  promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
  4744  harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,

  4746  or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
  4747  work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
  4748  Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

  4751  Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
  4752  
  4753  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
  4754  electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
  4755  including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
  4756  because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
  4757  people in all walks of life.
  4758  
  4759  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
  4760  assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
  4761  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
  4762  remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
  4763  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
  4764  and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

  4796  Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
  4797  Literary Archive Foundation
  4798  
  4799  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
  4800  spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
  4801  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
  4802  freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
  4803  array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
  4804  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
  4805  status with the IRS.
  4806  
  4807  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
  4808  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
  4809  States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
  4810  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
  4811  with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
  4812  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
  4813  SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
  4814  particular state visit http://pglaf.org
  4815  
  4816  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
  4817  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
  4818  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
  4819  approach us with offers to donate.
  4820  
  4821  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
  4822  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
  4823  outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
  4824  
  4825  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
  4826  methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
  4827  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

  4831  Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
  4832  works.
  4833  
  4834  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
  4835  concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
  4836  with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
  4837  Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
  4838  
  4839  
  4840  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
  4841  editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
  4842  unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
  4843  keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
  4844

  4848       http://www.gutenberg.org
  4849  
  4850  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
  4851  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
  4852  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
  4853  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

### The Data Engineer

 ![](https://www.clandestinecritic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/the-dark-knight-rises-poster-landscape.jpg)
 
A dedicated specialist that maintain data available and usable by others (Data Scientists).[^0]

Data engineers set up and operate the organization’s data infrastructure preparing it for further analysis by data analysts and scientists.[^0]

Data engineering field could be thought of as a superset of business intelligence and data warehousing that brings more elements from software engineering.[^2]

- a data engineer might create a new aggregate of a dataset containing trillions of streaming events 
-  analytics engineer might use that aggregate in a new report on global streaming quality 
-  a data scientist might build a new streaming compression model reading the report

### Data Warehouse: A Traditional Approach: 

> A data warehouse is a copy of transaction data specifically structured for query and analysis. — [Ralph Kimball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kimball)

<br>

> A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile collection of data in support of management’s decision making process.-- [Bill Inmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Inmon)

^ 
- A data warehouse is a central repository where raw data is transformed and stored in query-able forms.[^0]
- Data Warehouse are still relevant today and their maintenance is part of Data Engineers' resposibilities.
- The warehouse is created with structure and model first before the data is loaded and it is called schema-on-write.

###  Data Warehouse vs Data Bases

Surprisingly, Data Warehouse isn’t a regular database. 

[.column]

- A database normalizes data separating them into tables and avoiding redundancies 
- It supports arbitrary workload and complex queries 
- do not store multiple versions of data 
 
[.column]

- a Data Warehouse uses few tables to improve performance and analytics.
- a Data Warehouse allows simple queries 
- supports versioning for complex analysis


### Data Pipeline

 A Data pipeline is a sum of tools and processes for performing data integration [^0]
 
 Constructing data pipelines is the core responsibility of data engineering.

![](./attachments/1_62WJpBzEdlsjlc2TtjFf3g.jpg)

^  While data warehouse concerns the storage of data, data pipeline ensures the consumption and handling of it. 

### Data pipelines are used for

- moving data to the cloud or to a data warehouse
- data wrangling 
- data integration

### Transporting data from sources into a warehouse[^10]

### Two Paradigms (and a half): SQL- v.s. JVM-Centric Pipelines[^etls]

- **SQL-centric Pipelines** uses SQL dialects from Presto or Hive.  Pipelines (ETLs) are defined in a declarative way, and almost everything centers around SQL and tables. 

^ 
- PROs: SQL is easier to learn and can rely on good optimizers
- CONSs: 
	- Writing UDFs is troublesome because one has to write it in a different language (e.g. Java or Python)	
	- testing can be a lot more challenging due to this. 

- **JVM-centric Pipelines** uses languages like Java or Scala and often involves thinking data transformation in an imperative manner, e.g. in terms of key-value pairs. 

^ PROs: 
	- Writing User Defined Functions (UDFs) is less painful;
	- and testing jobs is relatively easy;
   CONs: Requires strong programming skills

* Drag & Drop...

[^etls]: we are focusing on ETL

### Skill Set: SQL mastery[^2]

If english is the language of business, SQL is the language of data.  

- SQL/DML/DDL primitives are simple enough that it should hold no secrets to a data engineer. Beyond the declarative nature of SQL, she/he should be able to read and
- understand database execution plans, and have an understanding of what
all the steps are, 
- understand how indices work, 
- understand the different join algorithms 

### Skill Set: Data modeling[^2]

For a data engineer, entity-relationship modeling should be a cognitive reflex, along with a clear understanding of normalization, and have a sharp intuition around denormalization tradeoffs. 

The data engineer should be familiar with dimensional modeling and the related concepts and lexical field.

# But...


### Engineers Shouldn’t (only) Write (SQL-based) ETL[^JeffMagnusson2016]

- Unless you need to process over many petabytes of data, or you’re ingesting hundreds of billions of events a day, most technologies have evolved to a point where they can trivially scale to your needs.

- Unless you need to push the boundaries of what these technologies are capable of, you probably don’t need a highly specialized team of dedicated engineers to build solutions on top of them. 


[^JeffMagnusson2016]: [https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/)

### If Not (only) ETL, Then…What?[^TristanHandy2019]

Data Engineers are still a critical part of any high-functioning data team.
- managing and optimizing core data infrastructure,
- building and maintaining custom ingestion pipelines,
- supporting data team resources with design and performance optimization, and
- building non-SQL transformation pipelines.

^ Instead of building ingestion pipelines that are available off-the-shelf and implementing SQL-based data transformations, here’s what your data engineers should be focused on:

### Data Lake
A Data lake is a vast pool of raw data (i.e., data as they are natively, unprocessed). A data lake stands out for its high agility as it isn’t limited to a warehouse’s fixed configuration. [^8]

[^8]:[ https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/what-is-data-engineering]( https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/what-is-data-engineering-explaining-the-data-pipeline-data-warehouse-and-data-engineer-role-1a4b182e0d16)

![inline](./attachments/datalake.png)

[Full Inforgraphic](./attachments/emc_understanding_data_lakes_infographic.pdf)

^ 
- In Data Lake, the raw data is loaded as-is, when the data is used it is given structure, and it is called schema-on-read.
- Data Lake gives engineers the ability to easily change.
- In practice, Data Lake is a commercial term so don't sweat it.

[.column]

- **Structured Data**
- **Schema On Write**
- **Data Pipelines: Extract-Transform-Load**
- **Processing Model: Batch**

[.column]

- **Unstructured Data**
- **Schema on Read**
- **Data Pipelines: Extract-Load-Transform**
- **Processing Model: Streaming**

### (Big) Data Engineer
 
In the contex of Big Data, a data engineer must focus on **distributed systems**, and **programming languages** such as Java and Scala is recommended.
 
### New Tasks

Since data lake are taking data from a wide range of systems, data can be in **structured** or **unstructured** formats, and usually **not clean**, e.g., with missing fields, mismatched data types, and other data-related issues.

Therefore  data engineers are challenged with the task of wrangling, cleansing, and integrating data.

### The Future of Data Engineering

- there has been a significant shift toward real-time data pipelines
- Increased connectivity between data sources and the data warehouse
- Self-service analytics via smart tools, made possible by data engineering
- Automation of Data Science functions
- Hybrid data architectures spanning on-premise and cloud environments

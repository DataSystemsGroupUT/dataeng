### Systems Overview: [[Apache Flink]] 

![inline](./attachments/Images/Flink.png)

Apache Flink is a distributed platform for streaming data (DataStream
API) and batch data (DataSet API). The dataflow engine, the core of the
platform, guarantees the fault tolerance during the distributed
computations. Apache Flink is based on the parallelization contract or
PACT, i.e., a programming model that generalizes MapReduce.

-  Flink programs are translated into Direct-Acyclic Graphs that
  describe the operations.

-  Such DAGs are further translated into low-level job graphs

-  Job graphs are generic streaming programs

However, the standard SQL commands such as \"Select\", \"Insert\", \"Update\", \"Delete\", \"Create\", and \"Drop\" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database. This tutorial will provide you with the instruction on the basics of each of these commands as well as allow you to put them to practice using the SQL Interpreter.\n",

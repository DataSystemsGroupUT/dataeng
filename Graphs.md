## What is a Graph?

Informally a *graph* is a set of nodes joined by a set of lines or arrows.

### Graph

G is an ordered triple $$G:=(V, E, f)$$
  -  V is a set of nodes, points, or vertices.
  -  E is a set, whose elements are known as edges or lines.
  -  $$f$$ is a function
		-  maps each element of E
		-  to an unordered pair of vertices in V.

### Vertexes and Edges

- A Vertex is a Basic Element
	-  Drawn as a *node* or a *dot* .
	-  The *Vertex set of a graph *G* is usually denoted by *V*

- An edge is *set* of two elements ^2cb8a1
	-  Drawn as a line connecting two vertices, called end vertices, or endpoints.
	-  The edge set of G is usually denoted by E(G), or E.
	 
	 
### Example


V:={1,2,3,4,5,6}

E:=\{\{1,2\},\{1,5\},\{2,3\},\{2,5\},\{3,4\},\{4,5\},\{4,6\}\}

alias: [WWW, Web]
---

International ecosystem of applications and services that allows us to search, aggregate, combine, transform, replicate, cache, and archive the information that underpins society. 

The Web is the result of millions of simple, small-scale interactions between agents and resources that use the founding technologies of HTTP and URI. [^121]

The Web is a set of widely commoditised servers, proxies, caches, and content delivery networks [an engineers]

### Resources

Resources are the fundamental building blocks

Anything we can expose, i.e., documents, images, videos, audio, devices, people, thingsâ€¦

We can represent them by abstracting the useful information and identifying using a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

### URIs

URL format (RFC 2396):
scheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]

E.G.:
git@github.com:nodejs/node.git
mongodb://root:pass@localhost:27017/TestDB?options?replicaSet=test
http://example.com


### Representation

Access to a resource is mediated by a representation

This separation is convenient to promote loose-coupling between server (producers) and	 client (consumers)

Multiple Views and Content Negotiation are the basis for interoperability

### Protocols: HTTP

[.column]
- GET 
	- Uniform Interface 
	- read-only operation 
	- idempotent

- POST 
	- like a resource upload 
	- idempotent
- DELETE 
	- remove resources 
	- idempotent
	
[.column]
- HEAD 
	- HEAD is like GET except it returns only a response code 
- PUT 
	the only non-idempotent and unsafe operation is allowed to modify the service in a unique way 
- OPTIONS is used to request information about the communication options of the resource

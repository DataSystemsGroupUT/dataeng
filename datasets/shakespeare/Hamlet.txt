    41  Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
    42  all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
    43  copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT! keep
    44  these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
    45  
    46  
    47  We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
    48  of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
    49  
    50  Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
    51  midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
    52  The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
    53  Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
    54  preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
    55  and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
    56  up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
    57  in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
    58  a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
    59  look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
    60  new copy has at least one byte more or less.

    63  Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
    64  
    65  We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
    66  time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
    67  to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
    68  searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
    69  projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
    70  per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
    71  million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
    72  files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
    73  If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
    74  total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
    75  
    76  The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
    77  Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
    78  This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
    79  which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
    80  
    81  At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
    82  of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
    83  manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
    84  from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
    85  assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
    86  more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
    87  don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
    88  
    89  We need your donations more than ever!

   147  Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
   148  They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
   149  your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
   150  someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
   151  fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
   152  disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
   153  you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
   154  
   155  *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
   156  By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
   157  etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
   158  this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
   159  a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
   160  sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
   161  you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
   162  medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
   163  
   164  ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
   165  This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
   166  tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
   167  Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
   168  Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
   169  things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
   170  on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
   171  distribute it in the United States without permission and
   172  without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
   173  below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
   174  under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
   175  
   176  To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
   177  efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
   178  works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
   179  medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
   180  things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
   181  corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
   182  intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
   183  disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
   184  codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
   185  
   186  LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
   187  But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
   188  [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
   189  etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
   190  liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
   191  legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
   192  UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
   193  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   194  OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
   195  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   196  
   197  If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
   198  receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
   199  you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
   200  time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
   201  on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
   202  such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
   203  copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
   204  choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
   205  receive it electronically.
   206  
   207  THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
   208  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
   209  TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
   210  LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   211  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   212  
   213  Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
   214  the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
   215  above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
   216  may have other legal rights.
   217  
   218  INDEMNITY
   219  You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
   220  officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
   221  and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
   222  indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
   223  [1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
   224  or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

   244            (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
   245            be used to convey punctuation intended by the
   246            author, and additional characters may be used to
   247            indicate hypertext links; OR
   248  
   249       [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
   250            no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent

   252            the case, for instance, with most word processors);
   253            OR
   254  
   255       [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
   256            no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

   261       "Small Print!" statement.
   262

   264       net profits you derive calculated using the method you
   265       already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
   266       don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
   267       payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon

   341  
   342  Fran.
   343  Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
   344  
   345  Ber.
   346  Long live the king!

   354  Fran.
   355  You come most carefully upon your hour.
   356  
   357  Ber.
   358  'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
   359  
   360  Fran.
   361  For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
   362  And I am sick at heart.
   363  
   364  Ber.
   365  Have you had quiet guard?
   366  
   367  Fran.
   368  Not a mouse stirring.
   369  
   370  Ber.
   371  Well, good night.
   372  If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
   373  The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
   374

   384  And liegemen to the Dane.
   385  
   386  Fran.
   387  Give you good-night.

   390  O, farewell, honest soldier;
   391  Who hath reliev'd you?
   392  
   393  Fran.
   394  Bernardo has my place.
   395  Give you good-night.

   403  Say.
   404  What, is Horatio there?
   405  
   406  Hor.
   407  A piece of him.
   408  
   409  Ber.
   410  Welcome, Horatio:--Welcome, good Marcellus.
   411  
   412  Mar.
   413  What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
   414  
   415  Ber.
   416  I have seen nothing.
   417  
   418  Mar.
   419  Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
   420  And will not let belief take hold of him
   421  Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
   422  Therefore I have entreated him along
   423  With us to watch the minutes of this night;
   424  That, if again this apparition come
   425  He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
   426  
   427  Hor.
   428  Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
   429  
   430  Ber.
   431  Sit down awhile,
   432  And let us once again assail your ears,
   433  That are so fortified against our story,
   434  What we two nights have seen.
   435  
   436  Hor.
   437  Well, sit we down,
   438  And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
   439  
   440  Ber.
   441  Last night of all,
   442  When yond same star that's westward from the pole
   443  Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
   444  Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
   445  The bell then beating one,--
   446  
   447  Mar.
   448  Peace, break thee off; look where it comes again!
   449  
   450  [Enter Ghost, armed.]
   451  
   452  Ber.
   453  In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
   454  
   455  Mar.
   456  Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
   457  
   458  Ber.
   459  Looks it not like the King? mark it, Horatio.
   460  
   461  Hor.
   462  Most like:--it harrows me with fear and wonder.
   463  
   464  Ber.
   465  It would be spoke to.
   466  
   467  Mar.
   468  Question it, Horatio.
   469  
   470  Hor.
   471  What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,
   472  Together with that fair and warlike form
   473  In which the majesty of buried Denmark
   474  Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!
   475  
   476  Mar.
   477  It is offended.
   478  
   479  Ber.
   480  See, it stalks away!
   481  
   482  Hor.
   483  Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
   484  
   485  [Exit Ghost.]
   486  
   487  Mar.
   488  'Tis gone, and will not answer.
   489  
   490  Ber.
   491  How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:
   492  Is not this something more than fantasy?
   493  What think you on't?
   494  
   495  Hor.
   496  Before my God, I might not this believe
   497  Without the sensible and true avouch
   498  Of mine own eyes.
   499  
   500  Mar.
   501  Is it not like the King?
   502  
   503  Hor.
   504  As thou art to thyself:
   505  Such was the very armour he had on
   506  When he the ambitious Norway combated;
   507  So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
   508  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
   509  'Tis strange.
   510  
   511  Mar.
   512  Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
   513  With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
   514  
   515  Hor.
   516  In what particular thought to work I know not;
   517  But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
   518  This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
   519  
   520  Mar.
   521  Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
   522  Why this same strict and most observant watch
   523  So nightly toils the subject of the land;
   524  And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
   525  And foreign mart for implements of war;
   526  Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
   527  Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
   528  What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
   529  Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
   530  Who is't that can inform me?
   531  
   532  Hor.
   533  That can I;
   534  At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
   535  Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
   536  Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
   537  Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
   538  Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,--
   539  For so this side of our known world esteem'd him,--
   540  Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
   541  Well ratified by law and heraldry,
   542  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,
   543  Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:
   544  Against the which, a moiety competent
   545  Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
   546  To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
   547  Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant,
   548  And carriage of the article design'd,
   549  His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
   550  Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
   551  Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
   552  Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
   553  For food and diet, to some enterprise
   554  That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,--
   555  As it doth well appear unto our state,--
   556  But to recover of us, by strong hand,
   557  And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
   558  So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
   559  Is the main motive of our preparations,
   560  The source of this our watch, and the chief head
   561  Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
   562  
   563  Ber.
   564  I think it be no other but e'en so:
   565  Well may it sort, that this portentous figure
   566  Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
   567  That was and is the question of these wars.
   568  
   569  Hor.
   570  A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
   571  In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
   572  A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
   573  The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
   574  Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
   575  As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
   576  Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,
   577  Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
   578  Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
   579  And even the like precurse of fierce events,--
   580  As harbingers preceding still the fates,
   581  And prologue to the omen coming on,--
   582  Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
   583  Unto our climature and countrymen.--
   584  But, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
   585  
   586  [Re-enter Ghost.]
   587  
   588  I'll cross it, though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!
   589  If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
   590  Speak to me:
   591  If there be any good thing to be done,
   592  That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
   593  Speak to me:
   594  If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
   595  Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
   596  O, speak!
   597  Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
   598  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
   599  For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
   600  [The cock crows.]
   601  Speak of it:--stay, and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus!
   602  
   603  Mar.
   604  Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
   605  
   606  Hor.
   607  Do, if it will not stand.
   608  
   609  Ber.
   610  'Tis here!
   611  
   612  Hor.
   613  'Tis here!
   614  
   615  Mar.
   616  'Tis gone!
   617  
   618  [Exit Ghost.]
   619  
   620  We do it wrong, being so majestical,
   621  To offer it the show of violence;
   622  For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
   623  And our vain blows malicious mockery.
   624  
   625  Ber.
   626  It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
   627  
   628  Hor.
   629  And then it started, like a guilty thing
   630  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
   631  The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
   632  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
   633  Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
   634  Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
   635  The extravagant and erring spirit hies
   636  To his confine: and of the truth herein
   637  This present object made probation.
   638  
   639  Mar.
   640  It faded on the crowing of the cock.
   641  Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
   642  Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
   643  The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
   644  And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
   645  The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
   646  No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;
   647  So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
   648  
   649  Hor.
   650  So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
   651  But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
   652  Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
   653  Break we our watch up: and by my advice,
   654  Let us impart what we have seen to-night
   655  Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
   656  This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:
   657  Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
   658  As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
   659  
   660  Mar.
   661  Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
   662  Where we shall find him most conveniently.
   663  
   664  [Exeunt.]
   665  
   666  
   667  
   668  Scene II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
   669  
   670  [Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand,
   671  Cornelius, Lords, and Attendant.]
   672  
   673  King.
   674  Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
   675  The memory be green, and that it us befitted
   676  To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
   677  To be contracted in one brow of woe;
   678  Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
   679  That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
   680  Together with remembrance of ourselves.
   681  Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
   682  Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
   683  Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
   684  With an auspicious and one dropping eye,
   685  With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
   686  In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
   687  Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
   688  Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
   689  With this affair along:--or all, our thanks.
   690  Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
   691  Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
   692  Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
   693  Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
   694  Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
   695  He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
   696  Importing the surrender of those lands
   697  Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
   698  To our most valiant brother. So much for him,--
   699  Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
   700  Thus much the business is:--we have here writ
   701  To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
   702  Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
   703  Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
   704  His further gait herein; in that the levies,
   705  The lists, and full proportions are all made
   706  Out of his subject:--and we here dispatch
   707  You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
   708  For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
   709  Giving to you no further personal power
   710  To business with the king, more than the scope
   711  Of these dilated articles allow.
   712  Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.
   713  
   714  Cor. and Volt.
   715  In that and all things will we show our duty.
   716  
   717  King.
   718  We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
   719  
   720  [Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]
   721  
   722  And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
   723  You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
   724  You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
   725  And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
   726  That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
   727  The head is not more native to the heart,
   728  The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
   729  Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
   730  What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
   731  
   732  Laer.
   733  Dread my lord,
   734  Your leave and favour to return to France;
   735  From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
   736  To show my duty in your coronation;
   737  Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
   738  My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
   739  And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
   740  
   741  King.
   742  Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
   743  
   744  Pol.
   745  He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
   746  By laboursome petition; and at last
   747  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
   748  I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
   749  
   750  King.
   751  Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
   752  And thy best graces spend it at thy will!--
   753  But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son--
   754  
   755  Ham.
   756  [Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
   757  
   758  King.
   759  How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
   760  
   761  Ham.
   762  Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
   763  
   764  Queen.
   765  Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
   766  And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
   767  Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
   768  Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
   769  Thou know'st 'tis common,--all that lives must die,
   770  Passing through nature to eternity.
   771  
   772  Ham.
   773  Ay, madam, it is common.
   774  
   775  Queen.
   776  If it be,
   777  Why seems it so particular with thee?
   778  
   779  Ham.
   780  Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.
   781  'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
   782  Nor customary suits of solemn black,
   783  Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
   784  No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
   785  Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
   786  Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,
   787  That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;
   788  For they are actions that a man might play;
   789  But I have that within which passeth show;
   790  These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
   791  
   792  King.
   793  'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
   794  To give these mourning duties to your father;
   795  But, you must know, your father lost a father;
   796  That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,
   797  In filial obligation, for some term
   798  To do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere
   799  In obstinate condolement is a course
   800  Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
   801  It shows a will most incorrect to heaven;
   802  A heart unfortified, a mind impatient;
   803  An understanding simple and unschool'd;
   804  For what we know must be, and is as common
   805  As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
   806  Why should we, in our peevish opposition,
   807  Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
   808  A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
   809  To reason most absurd; whose common theme
   810  Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
   811  From the first corse till he that died to-day,
   812  'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
   813  This unprevailing woe; and think of us
   814  As of a father: for let the world take note
   815  You are the most immediate to our throne;
   816  And with no less nobility of love
   817  Than that which dearest father bears his son
   818  Do I impart toward you. For your intent
   819  In going back to school in Wittenberg,
   820  It is most retrograde to our desire:
   821  And we beseech you bend you to remain
   822  Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
   823  Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
   824  
   825  Queen.
   826  Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
   827  I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
   828  
   829  Ham.
   830  I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
   831  
   832  King.
   833  Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
   834  Be as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come;
   835  This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
   836  Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
   837  No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
   838  But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;
   839  And the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
   840  Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
   841  
   842  [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
   843  
   844  Ham.
   845  O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
   846  Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
   847  Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
   848  His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!
   849  How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
   850  Seem to me all the uses of this world!
   851  Fie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
   852  That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
   853  Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
   854  But two months dead!--nay, not so much, not two:
   855  So excellent a king; that was, to this,
   856  Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,
   857  That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
   858  Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
   859  Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
   860  As if increase of appetite had grown
   861  By what it fed on: and yet, within a month,--
   862  Let me not think on't,--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
   863  A little month; or ere those shoes were old
   864  With which she followed my poor father's body
   865  Like Niobe, all tears;--why she, even she,--
   866  O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,
   867  Would have mourn'd longer,--married with mine uncle,
   868  My father's brother; but no more like my father
   869  Than I to Hercules: within a month;
   870  Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
   871  Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
   872  She married:-- O, most wicked speed, to post
   873  With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
   874  It is not, nor it cannot come to good;
   875  But break my heart,--for I must hold my tongue!
   876  
   877  [Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]
   878  
   879  Hor.
   880  Hail to your lordship!
   881  
   882  Ham.
   883  I am glad to see you well:
   884  Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
   885  
   886  Hor.
   887  The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
   888  
   889  Ham.
   890  Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
   891  And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--
   892  Marcellus?
   893  
   894  Mar.
   895  My good lord,--
   896  
   897  Ham.
   898  I am very glad to see you.--Good even, sir.--
   899  But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
   900  
   901  Hor.
   902  A truant disposition, good my lord.
   903  
   904  Ham.
   905  I would not hear your enemy say so;
   906  Nor shall you do my ear that violence,
   907  To make it truster of your own report
   908  Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
   909  But what is your affair in Elsinore?
   910  We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
   911  
   912  Hor.
   913  My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
   914  
   915  Ham.
   916  I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
   917  I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
   918  
   919  Hor.
   920  Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
   921  
   922  Ham.
   923  Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
   924  Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
   925  Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
   926  Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!--
   927  My father,--methinks I see my father.
   928  
   929  Hor.
   930  Where, my lord?
   931  
   932  Ham.
   933  In my mind's eye, Horatio.
   934  
   935  Hor.
   936  I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
   937  
   938  Ham.
   939  He was a man, take him for all in all,
   940  I shall not look upon his like again.
   941  
   942  Hor.
   943  My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
   944  
   945  Ham.
   946  Saw who?
   947  
   948  Hor.
   949  My lord, the king your father.
   950  
   951  Ham.
   952  The King my father!
   953  
   954  Hor.
   955  Season your admiration for awhile
   956  With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
   957  Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
   958  This marvel to you.
   959  
   960  Ham.
   961  For God's love let me hear.
   962  
   963  Hor.
   964  Two nights together had these gentlemen,
   965  Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch
   966  In the dead vast and middle of the night,
   967  Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
   968  Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
   969  Appears before them and with solemn march
   970  Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
   971  By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
   972  Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
   973  Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
   974  Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me
   975  In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
   976  And I with them the third night kept the watch:
   977  Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
   978  Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
   979  The apparition comes: I knew your father;
   980  These hands are not more like.
   981  
   982  Ham.
   983  But where was this?
   984  
   985  Mar.
   986  My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
   987  
   988  Ham.
   989  Did you not speak to it?
   990  
   991  Hor.
   992  My lord, I did;
   993  But answer made it none: yet once methought
   994  It lifted up it head, and did address
   995  Itself to motion, like as it would speak:
   996  But even then the morning cock crew loud,
   997  And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
   998  And vanish'd from our sight.
   999  
  1000  Ham.
  1001  'Tis very strange.
  1002  
  1003  Hor.
  1004  As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
  1005  And we did think it writ down in our duty
  1006  To let you know of it.
  1007  
  1008  Ham.
  1009  Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
  1010  Hold you the watch to-night?
  1011  
  1012  Mar. and Ber.
  1013  We do, my lord.
  1014  
  1015  Ham.
  1016  Arm'd, say you?
  1017  
  1018  Both.
  1019  Arm'd, my lord.
  1020  
  1021  Ham.
  1022  From top to toe?
  1023  
  1024  Both.
  1025  My lord, from head to foot.
  1026  
  1027  Ham.
  1028  Then saw you not his face?
  1029  
  1030  Hor.
  1031  O, yes, my lord: he wore his beaver up.
  1032  
  1033  Ham.
  1034  What, look'd he frowningly?
  1035  
  1036  Hor.
  1037  A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  1038  
  1039  Ham.
  1040  Pale or red?
  1041  
  1042  Hor.
  1043  Nay, very pale.
  1044  
  1045  Ham.
  1046  And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  1047  
  1048  Hor.
  1049  Most constantly.
  1050  
  1051  Ham.
  1052  I would I had been there.
  1053  
  1054  Hor.
  1055  It would have much amaz'd you.
  1056  
  1057  Ham.
  1058  Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  1059  
  1060  Hor.
  1061  While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  1062  
  1063  Mar. and Ber.
  1064  Longer, longer.
  1065  
  1066  Hor.
  1067  Not when I saw't.
  1068  
  1069  Ham.
  1070  His beard was grizzled,--no?
  1071  
  1072  Hor.
  1073  It was, as I have seen it in his life,
  1074  A sable silver'd.
  1075  
  1076  Ham.
  1077  I will watch to-night;
  1078  Perchance 'twill walk again.
  1079  
  1080  Hor.
  1081  I warr'nt it will.
  1082  
  1083  Ham.
  1084  If it assume my noble father's person,
  1085  I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
  1086  And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
  1087  If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
  1088  Let it be tenable in your silence still;
  1089  And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
  1090  Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
  1091  I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well:
  1092  Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
  1093  I'll visit you.
  1094  
  1095  All.
  1096  Our duty to your honour.
  1097  
  1098  Ham.
  1099  Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
  1100  
  1101  [Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]
  1102  
  1103  My father's spirit in arms! All is not well;
  1104  I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
  1105  Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
  1106  Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
  1107  
  1108  [Exit.]

  1111  
  1112  Scene III. A room in Polonius's house.
  1113  
  1114  [Enter Laertes and Ophelia.]
  1115  
  1116  Laer.
  1117  My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
  1118  And, sister, as the winds give benefit
  1119  And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
  1120  But let me hear from you.
  1121  
  1122  Oph.
  1123  Do you doubt that?
  1124  
  1125  Laer.
  1126  For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
  1127  Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood:
  1128  A violet in the youth of primy nature,
  1129  Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;
  1130  The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
  1131  No more.
  1132  
  1133  Oph.
  1134  No more but so?
  1135  
  1136  Laer.
  1137  Think it no more:
  1138  For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
  1139  In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
  1140  The inward service of the mind and soul
  1141  Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now;
  1142  And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
  1143  The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
  1144  His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
  1145  For he himself is subject to his birth:
  1146  He may not, as unvalu'd persons do,
  1147  Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
  1148  The safety and health of this whole state;
  1149  And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
  1150  Unto the voice and yielding of that body
  1151  Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
  1152  It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
  1153  As he in his particular act and place
  1154  May give his saying deed; which is no further
  1155  Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
  1156  Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
  1157  If with too credent ear you list his songs,
  1158  Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
  1159  To his unmaster'd importunity.
  1160  Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
  1161  And keep you in the rear of your affection,
  1162  Out of the shot and danger of desire.
  1163  The chariest maid is prodigal enough
  1164  If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
  1165  Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:
  1166  The canker galls the infants of the spring
  1167  Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd:
  1168  And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
  1169  Contagious blastments are most imminent.
  1170  Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
  1171  Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  1172  
  1173  Oph.
  1174  I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
  1175  As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
  1176  Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
  1177  Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
  1178  Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
  1179  Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
  1180  And recks not his own read.
  1181  
  1182  Laer.
  1183  O, fear me not.
  1184  I stay too long:--but here my father comes.
  1185  
  1186  [Enter Polonius.]
  1187  
  1188  A double blessing is a double grace;
  1189  Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  1190  
  1191  Pol.
  1192  Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
  1193  The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
  1194  And you are stay'd for. There,--my blessing with thee!
  1195  
  1196  [Laying his hand on Laertes's head.]
  1197  
  1198  And these few precepts in thy memory
  1199  Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
  1200  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
  1201  Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
  1202  Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
  1203  Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
  1204  But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
  1205  Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
  1206  Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,
  1207  Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
  1208  Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
  1209  Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
  1210  Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
  1211  But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
  1212  For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
  1213  And they in France of the best rank and station
  1214  Are most select and generous chief in that.
  1215  Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
  1216  For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
  1217  And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
  1218  This above all,--to thine own self be true;
  1219  And it must follow, as the night the day,
  1220  Thou canst not then be false to any man.
  1221  Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
  1222  
  1223  Laer.
  1224  Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  1225  
  1226  Pol.
  1227  The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
  1228  
  1229  Laer.
  1230  Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
  1231  What I have said to you.
  1232  
  1233  Oph.
  1234  'Tis in my memory lock'd,
  1235  And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  1236  
  1237  Laer.
  1238  Farewell.
  1239  
  1240  [Exit.]
  1241  
  1242  Pol.
  1243  What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  1244  
  1245  Oph.
  1246  So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  1247  
  1248  Pol.
  1249  Marry, well bethought:
  1250  'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
  1251  Given private time to you; and you yourself
  1252  Have of your audience been most free and bounteous;
  1253  If it be so,--as so 'tis put on me,
  1254  And that in way of caution,--I must tell you
  1255  You do not understand yourself so clearly
  1256  As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
  1257  What is between you? give me up the truth.
  1258  
  1259  Oph.
  1260  He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
  1261  Of his affection to me.
  1262  
  1263  Pol.
  1264  Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
  1265  Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
  1266  Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  1267  
  1268  Oph.
  1269  I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
  1270  
  1271  Pol.
  1272  Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
  1273  That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
  1274  Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
  1275  Or,--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
  1276  Wronging it thus,--you'll tender me a fool.
  1277  
  1278  Oph.
  1279  My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
  1280  In honourable fashion.
  1281  
  1282  Pol.
  1283  Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
  1284  
  1285  Oph.
  1286  And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
  1287  With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  1288  
  1289  Pol.
  1290  Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
  1291  When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
  1292  Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
  1293  Giving more light than heat,--extinct in both,
  1294  Even in their promise, as it is a-making,--
  1295  You must not take for fire. From this time
  1296  Be something scanter of your maiden presence;
  1297  Set your entreatments at a higher rate
  1298  Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
  1299  Believe so much in him, that he is young;
  1300  And with a larger tether may he walk
  1301  Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
  1302  Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,--
  1303  Not of that dye which their investments show,
  1304  But mere implorators of unholy suits,
  1305  Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
  1306  The better to beguile. This is for all,--
  1307  I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
  1308  Have you so slander any moment leisure
  1309  As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
  1310  Look to't, I charge you; come your ways.
  1311  
  1312  Oph.
  1313  I shall obey, my lord.
  1314  
  1315  [Exeunt.]
  1316  
  1317  
  1318  
  1319  Scene IV. The platform.
  1320  
  1321  [Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]
  1322  
  1323  Ham.
  1324  The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  1325  
  1326  Hor.
  1327  It is a nipping and an eager air.
  1328  
  1329  Ham.
  1330  What hour now?
  1331  
  1332  Hor.
  1333  I think it lacks of twelve.
  1334  
  1335  Mar.
  1336  No, it is struck.
  1337  
  1338  Hor.
  1339  Indeed? I heard it not: then draws near the season
  1340  Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
  1341  
  1342  [A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within.]
  1343  
  1344  What does this mean, my lord?
  1345  
  1346  Ham.
  1347  The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
  1348  Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
  1349  And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
  1350  The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
  1351  The triumph of his pledge.
  1352  
  1353  Hor.
  1354  Is it a custom?
  1355  
  1356  Ham.
  1357  Ay, marry, is't;
  1358  But to my mind,--though I am native here,
  1359  And to the manner born,--it is a custom
  1360  More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
  1361  This heavy-headed revel east and west
  1362  Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations:
  1363  They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
  1364  Soil our addition; and, indeed, it takes
  1365  From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
  1366  The pith and marrow of our attribute.
  1367  So oft it chances in particular men
  1368  That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
  1369  As in their birth,--wherein they are not guilty,
  1370  Since nature cannot choose his origin,--
  1371  By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
  1372  Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;
  1373  Or by some habit, that too much o'er-leavens
  1374  The form of plausive manners;--that these men,--
  1375  Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
  1376  Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
  1377  Their virtues else,--be they as pure as grace,
  1378  As infinite as man may undergo,--
  1379  Shall in the general censure take corruption
  1380  From that particular fault: the dram of eale
  1381  Doth all the noble substance often doubt
  1382  To his own scandal.
  1383  
  1384  Hor.
  1385  Look, my lord, it comes!
  1386  
  1387  [Enter Ghost.]
  1388  
  1389  Ham.
  1390  Angels and ministers of grace defend us!--
  1391  Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
  1392  Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
  1393  Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
  1394  Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
  1395  That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
  1396  King, father, royal Dane; O, answer me!
  1397  Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
  1398  Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
  1399  Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
  1400  Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
  1401  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
  1402  To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
  1403  That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
  1404  Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
  1405  Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
  1406  So horridly to shake our disposition
  1407  With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
  1408  Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
  1409  
  1410  [Ghost beckons Hamlet.]
  1411  
  1412  Hor.
  1413  It beckons you to go away with it,
  1414  As if it some impartment did desire
  1415  To you alone.
  1416  
  1417  Mar.
  1418  Look with what courteous action
  1419  It waves you to a more removed ground:
  1420  But do not go with it!
  1421  
  1422  Hor.
  1423  No, by no means.
  1424  
  1425  Ham.
  1426  It will not speak; then will I follow it.
  1427  
  1428  Hor.
  1429  Do not, my lord.
  1430  
  1431  Ham.
  1432  Why, what should be the fear?
  1433  I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
  1434  And for my soul, what can it do to that,
  1435  Being a thing immortal as itself?
  1436  It waves me forth again;--I'll follow it.
  1437  
  1438  Hor.
  1439  What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
  1440  Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
  1441  That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
  1442  And there assume some other horrible form
  1443  Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,
  1444  And draw you into madness? think of it:
  1445  The very place puts toys of desperation,
  1446  Without more motive, into every brain
  1447  That looks so many fadoms to the sea
  1448  And hears it roar beneath.
  1449  
  1450  Ham.
  1451  It waves me still.--
  1452  Go on; I'll follow thee.
  1453  
  1454  Mar.
  1455  You shall not go, my lord.
  1456  
  1457  Ham.
  1458  Hold off your hands.
  1459  
  1460  Hor.
  1461  Be rul'd; you shall not go.
  1462  
  1463  Ham.
  1464  My fate cries out,
  1465  And makes each petty artery in this body
  1466  As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.--
  1467  
  1468  [Ghost beckons.]
  1469  
  1470  Still am I call'd;--unhand me, gentlemen;--
  1471  
  1472  [Breaking free from them.]
  1473  
  1474  By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!--
  1475  I say, away!--Go on; I'll follow thee.
  1476  
  1477  [Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.]
  1478  
  1479  Hor.
  1480  He waxes desperate with imagination.

  1482  Mar.
  1483  Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
  1484  
  1485  Hor.
  1486  Have after.--To what issue will this come?
  1487  
  1488  Mar.
  1489  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  1490  
  1491  Hor.
  1492  Heaven will direct it.
  1493  
  1494  Mar.
  1495  Nay, let's follow him.

  1501  Scene V. A more remote part of the Castle.
  1502  
  1503  [Enter Ghost and Hamlet.]
  1504  
  1505  Ham.
  1506  Whither wilt thou lead me? speak! I'll go no further.
  1507  
  1508  Ghost.
  1509  Mark me.
  1510  
  1511  Ham.
  1512  I will.
  1513  
  1514  Ghost.
  1515  My hour is almost come,
  1516  When I to sulph'uous and tormenting flames
  1517  Must render up myself.
  1518  
  1519  Ham.
  1520  Alas, poor ghost!
  1521  
  1522  Ghost.
  1523  Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
  1524  To what I shall unfold.
  1525  
  1526  Ham.
  1527  Speak; I am bound to hear.
  1528  
  1529  Ghost.
  1530  So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  1531  
  1532  Ham.
  1533  What?
  1534  
  1535  Ghost.
  1536  I am thy father's spirit;
  1537  Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
  1538  And for the day confin'd to wastein fires,
  1539  Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
  1540  Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
  1541  To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
  1542  I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
  1543  Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
  1544  Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
  1545  Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
  1546  And each particular hair to stand on end
  1547  Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:
  1548  But this eternal blazon must not be
  1549  To ears of flesh and blood.--List, list, O, list!--
  1550  If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
  1551  
  1552  Ham.
  1553  O God!
  1554  
  1555  Ghost.
  1556  Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
  1557  
  1558  Ham.
  1559  Murder!
  1560  
  1561  Ghost.
  1562  Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
  1563  But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  1564  
  1565  Ham.
  1566  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  1567  As meditation or the thoughts of love,
  1568  May sweep to my revenge.
  1569  
  1570  Ghost.
  1571  I find thee apt;
  1572  And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
  1573  That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
  1574  Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
  1575  'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
  1576  A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
  1577  Is by a forged process of my death
  1578  Rankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,
  1579  The serpent that did sting thy father's life
  1580  Now wears his crown.
  1581  
  1582  Ham.
  1583  O my prophetic soul!
  1584  Mine uncle!
  1585  
  1586  Ghost.
  1587  Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
  1588  With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
  1589  O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
  1590  So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
  1591  The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
  1592  O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
  1593  From me, whose love was of that dignity
  1594  That it went hand in hand even with the vow
  1595  I made to her in marriage; and to decline
  1596  Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
  1597  To those of mine!
  1598  But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
  1599  Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;
  1600  So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
  1601  Will sate itself in a celestial bed
  1602  And prey on garbage.
  1603  But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
  1604  Brief let me be.--Sleeping within my orchard,
  1605  My custom always of the afternoon,
  1606  Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
  1607  With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
  1608  And in the porches of my ears did pour
  1609  The leperous distilment; whose effect
  1610  Holds such an enmity with blood of man
  1611  That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
  1612  The natural gates and alleys of the body;
  1613  And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
  1614  And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
  1615  The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;
  1616  And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
  1617  Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
  1618  All my smooth body.
  1619  Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,
  1620  Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
  1621  Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
  1622  Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;
  1623  No reckoning made, but sent to my account
  1624  With all my imperfections on my head:
  1625  O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  1626  If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
  1627  Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
  1628  A couch for luxury and damned incest.
  1629  But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,
  1630  Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
  1631  Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,
  1632  And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
  1633  To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
  1634  The glowworm shows the matin to be near,
  1635  And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
  1636  Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
  1637  
  1638  [Exit.]
  1639  
  1640  Ham.
  1641  O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
  1642  And shall I couple hell? O, fie!--Hold, my heart;
  1643  And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
  1644  But bear me stiffly up.--Remember thee!
  1645  Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
  1646  In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
  1647  Yea, from the table of my memory
  1648  I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
  1649  All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
  1650  That youth and observation copied there;
  1651  And thy commandment all alone shall live
  1652  Within the book and volume of my brain,
  1653  Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!--
  1654  O most pernicious woman!
  1655  O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
  1656  My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
  1657  That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
  1658  At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark:
  1659  
  1660  [Writing.]
  1661  
  1662  So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
  1663  It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me:'
  1664  I have sworn't.
  1665  
  1666  Hor.
  1667  [Within.] My lord, my lord,--
  1668  
  1669  Mar.
  1670  [Within.] Lord Hamlet,--
  1671  
  1672  Hor.
  1673  [Within.] Heaven secure him!
  1674  
  1675  Ham.
  1676  So be it!
  1677  
  1678  Mar.
  1679  [Within.] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  1680  
  1681  Ham.
  1682  Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  1683  
  1684  [Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
  1685  
  1686  Mar.
  1687  How is't, my noble lord?
  1688  
  1689  Hor.
  1690  What news, my lord?
  1691  
  1692  Ham.
  1693  O, wonderful!
  1694  
  1695  Hor.
  1696  Good my lord, tell it.
  1697  
  1698  Ham.
  1699  No; you'll reveal it.
  1700  
  1701  Hor.
  1702  Not I, my lord, by heaven.
  1703  
  1704  Mar.
  1705  Nor I, my lord.
  1706  
  1707  Ham.
  1708  How say you then; would heart of man once think it?--
  1709  But you'll be secret?
  1710  
  1711  Hor. and Mar.
  1712  Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  1713  
  1714  Ham.
  1715  There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
  1716  But he's an arrant knave.
  1717  
  1718  Hor.
  1719  There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
  1720  To tell us this.
  1721  
  1722  Ham.
  1723  Why, right; you are i' the right;
  1724  And so, without more circumstance at all,
  1725  I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
  1726  You, as your business and desires shall point you,--
  1727  For every man hath business and desire,
  1728  Such as it is;--and for my own poor part,
  1729  Look you, I'll go pray.
  1730  
  1731  Hor.
  1732  These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  1733  
  1734  Ham.
  1735  I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
  1736  Yes, faith, heartily.
  1737  
  1738  Hor.
  1739  There's no offence, my lord.
  1740  
  1741  Ham.
  1742  Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
  1743  And much offence too. Touching this vision here,--
  1744  It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
  1745  For your desire to know what is between us,
  1746  O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
  1747  As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
  1748  Give me one poor request.
  1749  
  1750  Hor.
  1751  What is't, my lord? we will.
  1752  
  1753  Ham.
  1754  Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  1755  
  1756  Hor. and Mar.
  1757  My lord, we will not.
  1758  
  1759  Ham.
  1760  Nay, but swear't.
  1761  
  1762  Hor.
  1763  In faith,
  1764  My lord, not I.
  1765  
  1766  Mar.
  1767  Nor I, my lord, in faith.
  1768  
  1769  Ham.
  1770  Upon my sword.
  1771  
  1772  Mar.
  1773  We have sworn, my lord, already.
  1774  
  1775  Ham.
  1776  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
  1777  
  1778  Ghost.
  1779  [Beneath.] Swear.
  1780  
  1781  Ham.
  1782  Ha, ha boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny?--
  1783  Come on!--you hear this fellow in the cellarage,--
  1784  Consent to swear.
  1785  
  1786  Hor.
  1787  Propose the oath, my lord.
  1788  
  1789  Ham.
  1790  Never to speak of this that you have seen,
  1791  Swear by my sword.
  1792  
  1793  Ghost.
  1794  [Beneath.] Swear.
  1795  
  1796  Ham.
  1797  Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.--
  1798  Come hither, gentlemen,
  1799  And lay your hands again upon my sword:
  1800  Never to speak of this that you have heard,
  1801  Swear by my sword.
  1802  
  1803  Ghost.
  1804  [Beneath.] Swear.
  1805  
  1806  Ham.
  1807  Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
  1808  A worthy pioner!--Once more remove, good friends.
  1809  
  1810  Hor.
  1811  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  1812  
  1813  Ham.
  1814  And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
  1815  There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
  1816  Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
  1817  But come;--
  1818  Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
  1819  How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,--
  1820  As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
  1821  To put an antic disposition on,--
  1822  That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
  1823  With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,
  1824  Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
  1825  As 'Well, well, we know'; or 'We could, an if we would';--
  1826  Or 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be, an if they might';--
  1827  Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
  1828  That you know aught of me:--this is not to do,
  1829  So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
  1830  Swear.
  1831  
  1832  Ghost.
  1833  [Beneath.] Swear.
  1834  
  1835  Ham.
  1836  Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!--So, gentlemen,
  1837  With all my love I do commend me to you:
  1838  And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
  1839  May do, to express his love and friending to you,
  1840  God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
  1841  And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
  1842  The time is out of joint:--O cursed spite,
  1843  That ever I was born to set it right!--
  1844  Nay, come, let's go together.

  1850  Act II.
  1851  
  1852  Scene I. A room in Polonius's house.
  1853  
  1854  [Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.]
  1855  
  1856  Pol.
  1857  Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  1858  
  1859  Rey.
  1860  I will, my lord.
  1861  
  1862  Pol.
  1863  You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
  1864  Before You visit him, to make inquiry
  1865  Of his behaviour.
  1866  
  1867  Rey.
  1868  My lord, I did intend it.
  1869  
  1870  Pol.
  1871  Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
  1872  Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
  1873  And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
  1874  What company, at what expense; and finding,
  1875  By this encompassment and drift of question,
  1876  That they do know my son, come you more nearer
  1877  Than your particular demands will touch it:
  1878  Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
  1879  As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
  1880  And in part him;--do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  1881  
  1882  Rey.
  1883  Ay, very well, my lord.
  1884  
  1885  Pol.
  1886  'And in part him;--but,' you may say, 'not well:
  1887  But if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
  1888  Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
  1889  What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
  1890  As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
  1891  But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
  1892  As are companions noted and most known
  1893  To youth and liberty.
  1894  
  1895  Rey.
  1896  As gaming, my lord.
  1897  
  1898  Pol.
  1899  Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
  1900  Drabbing:--you may go so far.
  1901  
  1902  Rey.
  1903  My lord, that would dishonour him.
  1904  
  1905  Pol.
  1906  Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
  1907  You must not put another scandal on him,
  1908  That he is open to incontinency;
  1909  That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
  1910  That they may seem the taints of liberty;
  1911  The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind;
  1912  A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
  1913  Of general assault.
  1914  
  1915  Rey.
  1916  But, my good lord,--
  1917  
  1918  Pol.
  1919  Wherefore should you do this?
  1920  
  1921  Rey.
  1922  Ay, my lord,
  1923  I would know that.
  1924  
  1925  Pol.
  1926  Marry, sir, here's my drift;
  1927  And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
  1928  You laying these slight sullies on my son
  1929  As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
  1930  Mark you,
  1931  Your party in converse, him you would sound,
  1932  Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
  1933  The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
  1934  He closes with you in this consequence;
  1935  'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'--
  1936  According to the phrase or the addition
  1937  Of man and country.
  1938  
  1939  Rey.
  1940  Very good, my lord.
  1941  
  1942  Pol.
  1943  And then, sir, does he this,--he does--What was I about to say?--
  1944  By the mass, I was about to say something:--Where did I leave?
  1945  
  1946  Rey.
  1947  At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
  1948  gentleman.'
  1949  
  1950  Pol.
  1951  At--closes in the consequence'--ay, marry!
  1952  He closes with you thus:--'I know the gentleman;
  1953  I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
  1954  Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
  1955  There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
  1956  There falling out at tennis': or perchance,
  1957  'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'--
  1958  Videlicet, a brothel,--or so forth.--
  1959  See you now;
  1960  Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
  1961  And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
  1962  With windlaces, and with assays of bias,
  1963  By indirections find directions out:
  1964  So, by my former lecture and advice,
  1965  Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  1966  
  1967  Rey.
  1968  My lord, I have.
  1969  
  1970  Pol.
  1971  God b' wi' you, fare you well.
  1972  
  1973  Rey.
  1974  Good my lord!
  1975  
  1976  Pol.
  1977  Observe his inclination in yourself.
  1978  
  1979  Rey.
  1980  I shall, my lord.
  1981  
  1982  Pol.
  1983  And let him ply his music.
  1984  
  1985  Rey.
  1986  Well, my lord.
  1987  
  1988  Pol.
  1989  Farewell!

  1991  [Exit Reynaldo.]
  1992  
  1993  [Enter Ophelia.]
  1994  
  1995  How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
  1996  
  1997  Oph.
  1998  Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  1999  
  2000  Pol.
  2001  With what, i' the name of God?
  2002  
  2003  Oph.
  2004  My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
  2005  Lord Hamlet,--with his doublet all unbrac'd;
  2006  No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
  2007  Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
  2008  Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
  2009  And with a look so piteous in purport
  2010  As if he had been loosed out of hell
  2011  To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
  2012  
  2013  Pol.
  2014  Mad for thy love?
  2015  
  2016  Oph.
  2017  My lord, I do not know;
  2018  But truly I do fear it.
  2019  
  2020  Pol.
  2021  What said he?
  2022  
  2023  Oph.
  2024  He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
  2025  Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
  2026  And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
  2027  He falls to such perusal of my face
  2028  As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
  2029  At last,--a little shaking of mine arm,
  2030  And thrice his head thus waving up and down,--
  2031  He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
  2032  As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
  2033  And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
  2034  And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd
  2035  He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
  2036  For out o' doors he went without their help,
  2037  And to the last bended their light on me.
  2038  
  2039  Pol.
  2040  Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
  2041  This is the very ecstasy of love;
  2042  Whose violent property fordoes itself,
  2043  And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
  2044  As oft as any passion under heaven
  2045  That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,--
  2046  What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  2047  
  2048  Oph.
  2049  No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
  2050  I did repel his letters and denied
  2051  His access to me.
  2052  
  2053  Pol.
  2054  That hath made him mad.
  2055  I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
  2056  I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
  2057  And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
  2058  It seems it as proper to our age
  2059  To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
  2060  As it is common for the younger sort
  2061  To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
  2062  This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
  2063  More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
  2064

  2069  Scene II. A room in the Castle.
  2070  
  2071  [Enter King, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants.]
  2072  
  2073  King.
  2074  Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
  2075  Moreover that we much did long to see you,
  2076  The need we have to use you did provoke
  2077  Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
  2078  Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,
  2079  Since nor the exterior nor the inward man
  2080  Resembles that it was. What it should be,
  2081  More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
  2082  So much from the understanding of himself,
  2083  I cannot dream of: I entreat you both
  2084  That, being of so young days brought up with him,
  2085  And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
  2086  That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
  2087  Some little time: so by your companies
  2088  To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
  2089  So much as from occasion you may glean,
  2090  Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
  2091  That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  2092  
  2093  Queen.
  2094  Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
  2095  And sure I am two men there are not living
  2096  To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
  2097  To show us so much gentry and good-will
  2098  As to expend your time with us awhile,
  2099  For the supply and profit of our hope,
  2100  Your visitation shall receive such thanks
  2101  As fits a king's remembrance.
  2102  
  2103  Ros.
  2104  Both your majesties
  2105  Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
  2106  Put your dread pleasures more into command
  2107  Than to entreaty.
  2108  
  2109  Guil.
  2110  We both obey,
  2111  And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
  2112  To lay our service freely at your feet,
  2113  To be commanded.
  2114  
  2115  King.
  2116  Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  2117  
  2118  Queen.
  2119  Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
  2120  And I beseech you instantly to visit
  2121  My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you,
  2122  And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  2123  
  2124  Guil.
  2125  Heavens make our presence and our practices
  2126  Pleasant and helpful to him!
  2127  
  2128  Queen.
  2129  Ay, amen!
  2130  
  2131  [Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants].
  2132  
  2133  [Enter Polonius.]
  2134  
  2135  Pol.
  2136  Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
  2137  Are joyfully return'd.
  2138  
  2139  King.
  2140  Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  2141  
  2142  Pol.
  2143  Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
  2144  I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
  2145  Both to my God and to my gracious king:
  2146  And I do think,--or else this brain of mine
  2147  Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
  2148  As it hath us'd to do,--that I have found
  2149  The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  2150  
  2151  King.
  2152  O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
  2153  
  2154  Pol.
  2155  Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
  2156  My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  2157  
  2158  King.
  2159  Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
  2160  
  2161  [Exit Polonius.]
  2162  
  2163  He tells me, my sweet queen, he hath found
  2164  The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  2165  
  2166  Queen.
  2167  I doubt it is no other but the main,--
  2168  His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  2169  
  2170  King.
  2171  Well, we shall sift him.
  2172  
  2173  [Enter Polonius, with Voltimand and Cornelius.]
  2174  
  2175  Welcome, my good friends!
  2176  Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
  2177  
  2178  Volt.
  2179  Most fair return of greetings and desires.
  2180  Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
  2181  His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
  2182  To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
  2183  But, better look'd into, he truly found
  2184  It was against your highness; whereat griev'd,--
  2185  That so his sickness, age, and impotence
  2186  Was falsely borne in hand,--sends out arrests
  2187  On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
  2188  Receives rebuke from Norway; and, in fine,
  2189  Makes vow before his uncle never more
  2190  To give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
  2191  Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
  2192  Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee;
  2193  And his commission to employ those soldiers,
  2194  So levied as before, against the Polack:
  2195  With an entreaty, herein further shown,
  2196  [Gives a paper.]
  2197  That it might please you to give quiet pass
  2198  Through your dominions for this enterprise,
  2199  On such regards of safety and allowance
  2200  As therein are set down.
  2201  
  2202  King.
  2203  It likes us well;
  2204  And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
  2205  Answer, and think upon this business.
  2206  Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
  2207  Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
  2208  Most welcome home!
  2209  
  2210  [Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]
  2211  
  2212  Pol.
  2213  This business is well ended.--
  2214  My liege, and madam,--to expostulate
  2215  What majesty should be, what duty is,
  2216  Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
  2217  Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
  2218  Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
  2219  And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
  2220  I will be brief:--your noble son is mad:
  2221  Mad call I it; for to define true madness,
  2222  What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
  2223  But let that go.
  2224  
  2225  Queen.
  2226  More matter, with less art.
  2227  
  2228  Pol.
  2229  Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
  2230  That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
  2231  And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
  2232  But farewell it, for I will use no art.
  2233  Mad let us grant him then: and now remains
  2234  That we find out the cause of this effect;
  2235  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  2236  For this effect defective comes by cause:
  2237  Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
  2238  Perpend.
  2239  I have a daughter,--have whilst she is mine,--
  2240  Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
  2241  Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
  2242  [Reads.]
  2243  'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
  2244  Ophelia,'--
  2245  That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
  2246  phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
  2247  [Reads.]
  2248  'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  2249  
  2250  Queen.
  2251  Came this from Hamlet to her?
  2252  
  2253  Pol.
  2254  Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
  2255  [Reads.]
  2256    'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
  2257       Doubt that the sun doth move;
  2258     Doubt truth to be a liar;
  2259       But never doubt I love.
  2260  'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
  2261  reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
  2262  it. Adieu.
  2263    'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
  2264       HAMLET.'
  2265  This, in obedience, hath my daughter show'd me;
  2266  And more above, hath his solicitings,
  2267  As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
  2268  All given to mine ear.
  2269  
  2270  King.
  2271  But how hath she
  2272  Receiv'd his love?
  2273  
  2274  Pol.
  2275  What do you think of me?
  2276  
  2277  King.
  2278  As of a man faithful and honourable.
  2279  
  2280  Pol.
  2281  I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
  2282  When I had seen this hot love on the wing,--
  2283  As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
  2284  Before my daughter told me,-- what might you,
  2285  Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
  2286  If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
  2287  Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;
  2288  Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;--
  2289  What might you think? No, I went round to work,
  2290  And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
  2291  'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;
  2292  This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
  2293  That she should lock herself from his resort,
  2294  Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
  2295  Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
  2296  And he, repulsed,--a short tale to make,--
  2297  Fell into a sadness; then into a fast;
  2298  Thence to a watch; thence into a weakness;
  2299  Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,
  2300  Into the madness wherein now he raves,
  2301  And all we wail for.
  2302  
  2303  King.
  2304  Do you think 'tis this?
  2305  
  2306  Queen.
  2307  It may be, very likely.
  2308  
  2309  Pol.
  2310  Hath there been such a time,--I'd fain know that--
  2311  That I have positively said ''Tis so,'
  2312  When it prov'd otherwise?
  2313  
  2314  King.
  2315  Not that I know.
  2316  
  2317  Pol.
  2318  Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
  2319  [Points to his head and shoulder.]
  2320  If circumstances lead me, I will find
  2321  Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
  2322  Within the centre.
  2323  
  2324  King.
  2325  How may we try it further?
  2326  
  2327  Pol.
  2328  You know sometimes he walks for hours together
  2329  Here in the lobby.
  2330  
  2331  Queen.
  2332  So he does indeed.
  2333  
  2334  Pol.
  2335  At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
  2336  Be you and I behind an arras then;
  2337  Mark the encounter: if he love her not,
  2338  And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
  2339  Let me be no assistant for a state,
  2340  But keep a farm and carters.
  2341  
  2342  King.
  2343  We will try it.
  2344  
  2345  Queen.
  2346  But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  2347  
  2348  Pol.
  2349  Away, I do beseech you, both away
  2350  I'll board him presently:--O, give me leave.
  2351  
  2352  [Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.]
  2353  
  2354  [Enter Hamlet, reading.]
  2355  
  2356  How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  2357  
  2358  Ham.
  2359  Well, God-a-mercy.
  2360  
  2361  Pol.
  2362  Do you know me, my lord?
  2363  
  2364  Ham.
  2365  Excellent well; you're a fishmonger.
  2366  
  2367  Pol.
  2368  Not I, my lord.
  2369  
  2370  Ham.
  2371  Then I would you were so honest a man.
  2372  
  2373  Pol.
  2374  Honest, my lord!
  2375  
  2376  Ham.
  2377  Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
  2378  picked out of ten thousand.
  2379  
  2380  Pol.
  2381  That's very true, my lord.
  2382  
  2383  Ham.
  2384  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing
  2385  carrion,--Have you a daughter?
  2386  
  2387  Pol.
  2388  I have, my lord.
  2389  
  2390  Ham.
  2391  Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing, but not
  2392  as your daughter may conceive:--friend, look to't.
  2393  
  2394  Pol.
  2395  How say you by that?--[Aside.] Still harping on my daughter:--yet
  2396  he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far
  2397  gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity
  2398  for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.--What do you
  2399  read, my lord?
  2400  
  2401  Ham.
  2402  Words, words, words.
  2403  
  2404  Pol.
  2405  What is the matter, my lord?
  2406  
  2407  Ham.
  2408  Between who?
  2409  
  2410  Pol.
  2411  I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  2412  
  2413  Ham.
  2414  Slanders, sir: for the satirical slave says here that old men
  2415  have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
  2416  purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
  2417  plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which,
  2418  sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
  2419  not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
  2420  should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.
  2421  
  2422  Pol.
  2423  [Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.--
  2424  Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
  2425  
  2426  Ham.
  2427  Into my grave?
  2428  
  2429  Pol.
  2430  Indeed, that is out o' the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes
  2431  his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
  2432  reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
  2433  will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
  2434  him and my daughter.--My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
  2435  my leave of you.
  2436  
  2437  Ham.
  2438  You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
  2439  willingly part withal,--except my life, except my life, except my
  2440  life.
  2441  
  2442  Pol.
  2443  Fare you well, my lord.
  2444  
  2445  Ham.
  2446  These tedious old fools!
  2447  
  2448  [Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
  2449  
  2450  Pol.
  2451  You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
  2452  
  2453  Ros.
  2454  [To Polonius.] God save you, sir!
  2455  
  2456  [Exit Polonius.]
  2457  
  2458  Guil.
  2459  My honoured lord!
  2460  
  2461  Ros.
  2462  My most dear lord!
  2463  
  2464  Ham.
  2465  My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
  2466  Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  2467  
  2468  Ros.
  2469  As the indifferent children of the earth.
  2470  
  2471  Guil.
  2472  Happy in that we are not over-happy;
  2473  On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  2474  
  2475  Ham.
  2476  Nor the soles of her shoe?
  2477  
  2478  Ros.
  2479  Neither, my lord.
  2480  
  2481  Ham.
  2482  Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
  2483  favours?
  2484  
  2485  Guil.
  2486  Faith, her privates we.
  2487  
  2488  Ham.
  2489  In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a
  2490  strumpet. What's the news?
  2491  
  2492  Ros.
  2493  None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  2494  
  2495  Ham.
  2496  Then is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me
  2497  question more in particular: what have you, my good friends,
  2498  deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison
  2499  hither?
  2500  
  2501  Guil.
  2502  Prison, my lord!
  2503  
  2504  Ham.
  2505  Denmark's a prison.
  2506  
  2507  Ros.
  2508  Then is the world one.
  2509  
  2510  Ham.
  2511  A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
  2512  dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
  2513  
  2514  Ros.
  2515  We think not so, my lord.
  2516  
  2517  Ham.
  2518  Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
  2519  or bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.
  2520  
  2521  Ros.
  2522  Why, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your
  2523  mind.
  2524  
  2525  Ham.
  2526  O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a
  2527  king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  2528  
  2529  Guil.
  2530  Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of
  2531  the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  2532  
  2533  Ham.
  2534  A dream itself is but a shadow.
  2535  
  2536  Ros.
  2537  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
  2538  it is but a shadow's shadow.
  2539  
  2540  Ham.
  2541  Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
  2542  heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my
  2543  fay, I cannot reason.
  2544  
  2545  Ros. and Guild.
  2546  We'll wait upon you.
  2547  
  2548  Ham.
  2549  No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my
  2550  servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
  2551  dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what
  2552  make you at Elsinore?
  2553  
  2554  Ros.
  2555  To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  2556  
  2557  Ham.
  2558  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:
  2559  and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
  2560  you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
  2561  visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
  2562  
  2563  Guil.
  2564  What should we say, my lord?
  2565  
  2566  Ham.
  2567  Why, anything--but to the purpose. You were sent for; and
  2568  there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
  2569  have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen
  2570  have sent for you.
  2571  
  2572  Ros.
  2573  To what end, my lord?
  2574  
  2575  Ham.
  2576  That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights
  2577  of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
  2578  obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
  2579  better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
  2580  me, whether you were sent for or no.
  2581  
  2582  Ros.
  2583  [To Guildenstern.] What say you?
  2584  
  2585  Ham.
  2586  [Aside.] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you love me, hold
  2587  not off.
  2588  
  2589  Guil.
  2590  My lord, we were sent for.
  2591  
  2592  Ham.
  2593  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
  2594  discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
  2595  feather. I have of late,--but wherefore I know not,--lost all my
  2596  mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
  2597  heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
  2598  seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
  2599  air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
  2600  roof fretted with golden fire,--why, it appears no other thing
  2601  to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
  2602  piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in
  2603  faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in
  2604  action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the
  2605  beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what
  2606  is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman
  2607  neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  2608  
  2609  Ros.
  2610  My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  2611  
  2612  Ham.
  2613  Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  2614  
  2615  Ros.
  2616  To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
  2617  entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them
  2618  on the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  2619  
  2620  Ham.
  2621  He that plays the king shall be welcome,--his majesty shall
  2622  have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
  2623  target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
  2624  end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
  2625  lungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind
  2626  freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
  2627  they?
  2628  
  2629  Ros.
  2630  Even those you were wont to take such delight in,--the
  2631  tragedians of the city.
  2632  
  2633  Ham.
  2634  How chances it they travel? their residence, both in
  2635  reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  2636  
  2637  Ros.
  2638  I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
  2639  innovation.
  2640  
  2641  Ham.
  2642  Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
  2643  city? Are they so followed?
  2644  
  2645  Ros.
  2646  No, indeed, are they not.
  2647  
  2648  Ham.
  2649  How comes it? do they grow rusty?
  2650  
  2651  Ros.
  2652  Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,
  2653  sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
  2654  of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are
  2655  now the fashion; and so berattle the common stages,--so they call
  2656  them,--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and
  2657  dare scarce come thither.
  2658  
  2659  Ham.
  2660  What, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they
  2661  escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
  2662  sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
  2663  themselves to common players,--as it is most like, if their means
  2664  are no better,--their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
  2665  against their own succession?
  2666  
  2667  Ros.
  2668  Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
  2669  holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for
  2670  awhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
  2671  went to cuffs in the question.
  2672  
  2673  Ham.
  2674  Is't possible?
  2675  
  2676  Guil.
  2677  O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  2678  
  2679  Ham.
  2680  Do the boys carry it away?
  2681  
  2682  Ros.
  2683  Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
  2684  
  2685  Ham.
  2686  It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and
  2687  those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give
  2688  twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in
  2689  little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
  2690  philosophy could find it out.
  2691  
  2692  [Flourish of trumpets within.]
  2693  
  2694  Guil.
  2695  There are the players.
  2696  
  2697  Ham.
  2698  Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come: the
  2699  appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply
  2700  with you in this garb; lest my extent to the players, which I
  2701  tell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like
  2702  entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father
  2703  and aunt-mother are deceived.
  2704  
  2705  Guil.
  2706  In what, my dear lord?
  2707  
  2708  Ham.
  2709  I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I
  2710  know a hawk from a handsaw.
  2711  
  2712  [Enter Polonius.]
  2713  
  2714  Pol.
  2715  Well be with you, gentlemen!
  2716  
  2717  Ham.
  2718  Hark you, Guildenstern;--and you too;--at each ear a hearer: that
  2719  great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
  2720  
  2721  Ros.
  2722  Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
  2723  man is twice a child.
  2724  
  2725  Ham.
  2726  I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.--You
  2727  say right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.
  2728  
  2729  Pol.
  2730  My lord, I have news to tell you.
  2731  
  2732  Ham.
  2733  My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
  2734  Rome,--
  2735  
  2736  Pol.
  2737  The actors are come hither, my lord.
  2738  
  2739  Ham.
  2740  Buzz, buzz!
  2741  
  2742  Pol.
  2743  Upon my honour,--
  2744  
  2745  Ham.
  2746  Then came each actor on his ass,--
  2747  
  2748  Pol.
  2749  The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
  2750  history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
  2751  tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene
  2752  individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor
  2753  Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
  2754  the only men.
  2755  
  2756  Ham.
  2757  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  2758  
  2759  Pol.
  2760  What treasure had he, my lord?
  2761  
  2762  Ham.
  2763  Why--
  2764     'One fair daughter, and no more,
  2765     The which he loved passing well.'
  2766  
  2767  
  2768  Pol.
  2769  [Aside.] Still on my daughter.
  2770  
  2771  Ham.
  2772  Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
  2773  
  2774  Pol.
  2775  If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
  2776  love passing well.
  2777  
  2778  Ham.
  2779  Nay, that follows not.
  2780  
  2781  Pol.
  2782  What follows, then, my lord?
  2783  
  2784  Ham.
  2785  Why--
  2786     'As by lot, God wot,'
  2787  and then, you know,
  2788     'It came to pass, as most like it was--'
  2789  The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
  2790  where my abridgment comes.
  2791  
  2792  [Enter four or five Players.]
  2793  
  2794  You are welcome, masters; welcome, all:--I am glad to see thee
  2795  well.--welcome, good friends.--O, my old friend! Thy face is
  2796  valanc'd since I saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in
  2797  Denmark?--What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your
  2798  ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
  2799  altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of
  2800  uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.--Masters, you are
  2801  all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
  2802  anything we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a
  2803  taste of your quality: come, a passionate speech.
  2804  
  2805  I Play.
  2806  What speech, my lord?
  2807  
  2808  Ham.
  2809  I heard thee speak me a speech once,--but it was never acted;
  2810  or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased
  2811  not the million, 'twas caviare to the general; but it was,--as I
  2812  received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
  2813  the top of mine,--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
  2814  set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said
  2815  there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
  2816  nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of
  2817  affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as
  2818  sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it
  2819  I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
  2820  especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in
  2821  your memory, begin at this line;--let me see, let me see:--
  2822  
  2823  The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,--
  2824  
  2825  it is not so:-- it begins with Pyrrhus:--
  2826  
  2827    'The rugged Pyrrhus,--he whose sable arms,
  2828     Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
  2829     When he lay couched in the ominous horse,--
  2830     Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
  2831     With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
  2832     Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
  2833     With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
  2834     Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
  2835     That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
  2836     To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,
  2837     And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
  2838     With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
  2839     Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
  2840  
  2841  So, proceed you.
  2842  
  2843  Pol.
  2844  'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
  2845  discretion.
  2846  
  2847  I Play.
  2848     Anon he finds him,
  2849     Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,
  2850     Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
  2851     Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
  2852     Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
  2853     But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
  2854     The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
  2855     Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
  2856     Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash
  2857     Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,
  2858     Which was declining on the milky head
  2859     Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
  2860     So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;
  2861     And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
  2862     Did nothing.
  2863     But as we often see, against some storm,
  2864     A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
  2865     The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
  2866     As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
  2867     Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
  2868     A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;
  2869     And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
  2870     On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
  2871     With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
  2872     Now falls on Priam.--
  2873     Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
  2874     In general synod, take away her power;
  2875     Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
  2876     And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
  2877     As low as to the fiends!
  2878  
  2879  Pol.
  2880  This is too long.
  2881  
  2882  Ham.
  2883  It shall to the barber's, with your beard.--Pr'ythee say on.--
  2884  He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps:--say on; come
  2885  to Hecuba.
  2886  
  2887  I Play.
  2888     But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,--
  2889  
  2890  Ham.
  2891  'The mobled queen'?
  2892  
  2893  Pol.
  2894  That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
  2895  
  2896  I Play.
  2897     Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
  2898     With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
  2899     Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
  2900     About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
  2901     A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;--
  2902     Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
  2903     'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:
  2904     But if the gods themselves did see her then,
  2905     When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
  2906     In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
  2907     The instant burst of clamour that she made,--
  2908     Unless things mortal move them not at all,--
  2909     Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
  2910     And passion in the gods.
  2911  
  2912  Pol.
  2913  Look, whether he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
  2914  eyes.--Pray you, no more!
  2915  
  2916  Ham.
  2917  'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.--
  2918  Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you
  2919  hear? Let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief
  2920  chronicles of the time; after your death you were better have a
  2921  bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  2922  
  2923  Pol.
  2924  My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  2925  
  2926  Ham.
  2927  Odd's bodikin, man, better: use every man after his
  2928  desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own
  2929  honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in
  2930  your bounty. Take them in.
  2931  
  2932  Pol.
  2933  Come, sirs.
  2934

  2943  I Play.
  2944  Ay, my lord.
  2945  
  2946  Ham.
  2947  We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
  2948  speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
  2949  insert in't? could you not?
  2950  
  2951  I Play.
  2952  Ay, my lord.
  2953

  2955  Very well.--Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.
  2956  
  2957  [Exit First Player.]
  2958  
  2959  --My good friends [to Ros. and Guild.], I'll leave you till
  2960  night: you are welcome to Elsinore.
  2961  
  2962  Ros.
  2963  Good my lord!
  2964  
  2965  [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
  2966  
  2967  Ham.
  2968  Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
  2969  Now I am alone.
  2970  O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
  2971  Is it not monstrous that this player here,
  2972  But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
  2973  Could force his soul so to his own conceit
  2974  That from her working all his visage wan'd;
  2975  Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
  2976  A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
  2977  With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
  2978  For Hecuba?
  2979  What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
  2980  That he should weep for her? What would he do,
  2981  Had he the motive and the cue for passion
  2982  That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
  2983  And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
  2984  Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;
  2985  Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,
  2986  The very faculties of eyes and ears.
  2987  Yet I,
  2988  A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
  2989  Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
  2990  And can say nothing; no, not for a king
  2991  Upon whose property and most dear life
  2992  A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
  2993  Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
  2994  Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
  2995  Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat
  2996  As deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?
  2997  'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
  2998  But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
  2999  To make oppression bitter; or ere this
  3000  I should have fatted all the region kites
  3001  With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
  3002  Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
  3003  O, vengeance!
  3004  Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
  3005  That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
  3006  Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
  3007  Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words
  3008  And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
  3009  A scullion!
  3010  Fie upon't! foh!--About, my brain! I have heard
  3011  That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
  3012  Have by the very cunning of the scene
  3013  Been struck so to the soul that presently
  3014  They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
  3015  For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
  3016  With most miraculous organ, I'll have these players
  3017  Play something like the murder of my father
  3018  Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
  3019  I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
  3020  I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
  3021  May be the devil: and the devil hath power
  3022  To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
  3023  Out of my weakness and my melancholy,--
  3024  As he is very potent with such spirits,--
  3025  Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
  3026  More relative than this.--the play's the thing
  3027  Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

  3034  ACT III.
  3035  
  3036  Scene I. A room in the Castle.
  3037  
  3038  [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and
  3039  Guildenstern.]
  3040  
  3041  King.
  3042  And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
  3043  Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
  3044  Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
  3045  With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  3046  
  3047  Ros.
  3048  He does confess he feels himself distracted,
  3049  But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  3050  
  3051  Guil.
  3052  Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
  3053  But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof
  3054  When we would bring him on to some confession
  3055  Of his true state.
  3056  
  3057  Queen.
  3058  Did he receive you well?
  3059  
  3060  Ros.
  3061  Most like a gentleman.
  3062  
  3063  Guil.
  3064  But with much forcing of his disposition.
  3065  
  3066  Ros.
  3067  Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
  3068  Most free in his reply.
  3069  
  3070  Queen.
  3071  Did you assay him
  3072  To any pastime?
  3073  
  3074  Ros.
  3075  Madam, it so fell out that certain players
  3076  We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,
  3077  And there did seem in him a kind of joy
  3078  To hear of it: they are about the court,
  3079  And, as I think, they have already order
  3080  This night to play before him.
  3081  
  3082  Pol.
  3083  'Tis most true;
  3084  And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
  3085  To hear and see the matter.
  3086  
  3087  King.
  3088  With all my heart; and it doth much content me
  3089  To hear him so inclin'd.--
  3090  Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
  3091  And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  3092  
  3093  Ros.
  3094  We shall, my lord.
  3095  
  3096  [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
  3097  
  3098  King.
  3099  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
  3100  For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
  3101  That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
  3102  Affront Ophelia:
  3103  Her father and myself,--lawful espials,--
  3104  Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
  3105  We may of their encounter frankly judge;
  3106  And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
  3107  If't be the affliction of his love or no
  3108  That thus he suffers for.
  3109  
  3110  Queen.
  3111  I shall obey you:--
  3112  And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
  3113  That your good beauties be the happy cause
  3114  Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
  3115  Will bring him to his wonted way again,
  3116  To both your honours.
  3117  
  3118  Oph.
  3119  Madam, I wish it may.
  3120  
  3121  [Exit Queen.]
  3122  
  3123  Pol.
  3124  Ophelia, walk you here.--Gracious, so please you,
  3125  We will bestow ourselves.--[To Ophelia.] Read on this book;
  3126  That show of such an exercise may colour
  3127  Your loneliness.--We are oft to blame in this,--
  3128  'Tis too much prov'd,--that with devotion's visage
  3129  And pious action we do sugar o'er
  3130  The Devil himself.
  3131  
  3132  King.
  3133  [Aside.] O, 'tis too true!
  3134  How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
  3135  The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
  3136  Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
  3137  Than is my deed to my most painted word:
  3138  O heavy burden!
  3139  
  3140  Pol.
  3141  I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
  3142  
  3143  [Exeunt King and Polonius.]
  3144  
  3145  [Enter Hamlet.]
  3146  
  3147  Ham.
  3148  To be, or not to be,--that is the question:--
  3149  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
  3150  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
  3151  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
  3152  And by opposing end them?--To die,--to sleep,--
  3153  No more; and by a sleep to say we end
  3154  The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
  3155  That flesh is heir to,--'tis a consummation
  3156  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die,--to sleep;--
  3157  To sleep! perchance to dream:--ay, there's the rub;
  3158  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
  3159  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
  3160  Must give us pause: there's the respect
  3161  That makes calamity of so long life;
  3162  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
  3163  The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
  3164  The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
  3165  The insolence of office, and the spurns
  3166  That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
  3167  When he himself might his quietus make
  3168  With a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,
  3169  To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
  3170  But that the dread of something after death,--
  3171  The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
  3172  No traveller returns,--puzzles the will,
  3173  And makes us rather bear those ills we have
  3174  Than fly to others that we know not of?
  3175  Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
  3176  And thus the native hue of resolution
  3177  Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
  3178  And enterprises of great pith and moment,
  3179  With this regard, their currents turn awry,
  3180  And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
  3181  The fair Ophelia!--Nymph, in thy orisons
  3182  Be all my sins remember'd.
  3183  
  3184  Oph.
  3185  Good my lord,
  3186  How does your honour for this many a day?
  3187  
  3188  Ham.
  3189  I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  3190  
  3191  Oph.
  3192  My lord, I have remembrances of yours
  3193  That I have longed long to re-deliver.
  3194  I pray you, now receive them.
  3195  
  3196  Ham.
  3197  No, not I;
  3198  I never gave you aught.
  3199  
  3200  Oph.
  3201  My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
  3202  And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
  3203  As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
  3204  Take these again; for to the noble mind
  3205  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  3206  There, my lord.
  3207  
  3208  Ham.
  3209  Ha, ha! are you honest?
  3210  
  3211  Oph.
  3212  My lord?
  3213  
  3214  Ham.
  3215  Are you fair?
  3216  
  3217  Oph.
  3218  What means your lordship?
  3219  
  3220  Ham.
  3221  That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
  3222  discourse to your beauty.
  3223  
  3224  Oph.
  3225  Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
  3226  
  3227  Ham.
  3228  Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
  3229  honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
  3230  translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox,
  3231  but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  3232  
  3233  Oph.
  3234  Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  3235  
  3236  Ham.
  3237  You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
  3238  inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you
  3239  not.
  3240  
  3241  Oph.
  3242  I was the more deceived.
  3243  
  3244  Ham.
  3245  Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of
  3246  sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse
  3247  me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me:
  3248  I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
  3249  beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
  3250  them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
  3251  do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all;
  3252  believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
  3253  father?
  3254  
  3255  Oph.
  3256  At home, my lord.
  3257  
  3258  Ham.
  3259  Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
  3260  nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  3261  
  3262  Oph.
  3263  O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  3264  
  3265  Ham.
  3266  If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry,--
  3267  be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
  3268  calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt
  3269  needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
  3270  monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
  3271  Farewell.
  3272  
  3273  Oph.
  3274  O heavenly powers, restore him!
  3275  
  3276  Ham.
  3277  I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath
  3278  given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you
  3279  amble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your
  3280  wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made
  3281  me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are
  3282  married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as
  3283  they are. To a nunnery, go.
  3284  
  3285  [Exit.]
  3286  
  3287  Oph.
  3288  O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
  3289  The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
  3290  The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
  3291  The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
  3292  The observ'd of all observers,--quite, quite down!
  3293  And I, of ladies most deject and wretched
  3294  That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
  3295  Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
  3296  Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
  3297  That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
  3298  Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
  3299  To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
  3300  
  3301  [Re-enter King and Polonius.]
  3302  
  3303  King.
  3304  Love! his affections do not that way tend;
  3305  Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
  3306  Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
  3307  O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
  3308  And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
  3309  Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
  3310  I have in quick determination
  3311  Thus set it down:--he shall with speed to England
  3312  For the demand of our neglected tribute:
  3313  Haply the seas, and countries different,
  3314  With variable objects, shall expel
  3315  This something-settled matter in his heart;
  3316  Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
  3317  From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  3318  
  3319  Pol.
  3320  It shall do well: but yet do I believe
  3321  The origin and commencement of his grief
  3322  Sprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia!
  3323  You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
  3324  We heard it all.--My lord, do as you please;
  3325  But if you hold it fit, after the play,
  3326  Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
  3327  To show his grief: let her be round with him;
  3328  And I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear
  3329  Of all their conference. If she find him not,
  3330  To England send him; or confine him where
  3331  Your wisdom best shall think.
  3332  
  3333  King.
  3334  It shall be so:
  3335  Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
  3336  
  3337  [Exeunt.]

  3340  
  3341  Scene II. A hall in the Castle.
  3342  
  3343  [Enter Hamlet and certain Players.]
  3344  
  3345  Ham.
  3346  Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
  3347  trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your
  3348  players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
  3349  not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
  3350  gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
  3351  whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a
  3352  temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
  3353  soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
  3354  tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who,
  3355  for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
  3356  shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing
  3357  Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.
  3358  
  3359  I Player.
  3360  I warrant your honour.
  3361  
  3362  Ham.
  3363  Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
  3364  tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
  3365  this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
  3366  nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
  3367  whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
  3368  'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,
  3369  scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
  3370  form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though
  3371  it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
  3372  grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,
  3373  o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
  3374  have seen play,--and heard others praise, and that highly,--not
  3375  to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of
  3376  Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
  3377  strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's
  3378  journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
  3379  humanity so abominably.
  3380  
  3381  I Player.
  3382  I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
  3383  
  3384  Ham.
  3385  O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns
  3386  speak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them
  3387  that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
  3388  spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary
  3389  question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous
  3390  and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
  3391  make you ready.
  3392  
  3393  [Exeunt Players.]
  3394  
  3395  [Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]
  3396  
  3397  How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?
  3398  
  3399  Pol.
  3400  And the queen too, and that presently.
  3401  
  3402  Ham.
  3403  Bid the players make haste.
  3404  
  3405  [Exit Polonius.]
  3406  
  3407  Will you two help to hasten them?
  3408  
  3409  Ros. and Guil.
  3410  We will, my lord.
  3411  
  3412  [Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]
  3413  
  3414  Ham.
  3415  What, ho, Horatio!
  3416  
  3417  [Enter Horatio.]
  3418  
  3419  Hor.
  3420  Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  3421  
  3422  Ham.
  3423  Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
  3424  As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  3425  
  3426  Hor.
  3427  O, my dear lord,--
  3428  
  3429  Ham.
  3430  Nay, do not think I flatter;
  3431  For what advancement may I hope from thee,
  3432  That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
  3433  To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
  3434  No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;
  3435  And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
  3436  Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
  3437  Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,
  3438  And could of men distinguish, her election
  3439  Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been
  3440  As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
  3441  A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
  3442  Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those
  3443  Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
  3444  That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
  3445  To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
  3446  That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
  3447  In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
  3448  As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
  3449  There is a play to-night before the king;
  3450  One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
  3451  Which I have told thee, of my father's death:
  3452  I pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,
  3453  Even with the very comment of thy soul
  3454  Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
  3455  Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
  3456  It is a damned ghost that we have seen;
  3457  And my imaginations are as foul
  3458  As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
  3459  For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;
  3460  And, after, we will both our judgments join
  3461  In censure of his seeming.
  3462  
  3463  Hor.
  3464  Well, my lord:
  3465  If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
  3466  And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
  3467  
  3468  Ham.
  3469  They are coming to the play. I must be idle:
  3470  Get you a place.

  3476  How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  3477  
  3478  Ham.
  3479  Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air,
  3480  promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
  3481  
  3482  King.
  3483  I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not
  3484  mine.
  3485  
  3486  Ham.
  3487  No, nor mine now. My lord, you play'd once i' the university, you
  3488  say? [To Polonius.]
  3489  
  3490  Pol.
  3491  That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  3492  
  3493  Ham.
  3494  What did you enact?
  3495  
  3496  Pol.
  3497  I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' the Capitol; Brutus
  3498  killed me.
  3499  
  3500  Ham.
  3501  It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.--Be
  3502  the players ready?

  3505  Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

  3507  Queen.
  3508  Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  3509  
  3510  Ham.
  3511  No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
  3512  
  3513  Pol.
  3514  O, ho! do you mark that? [To the King.]
  3515  
  3516  Ham.
  3517  Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

  3521  No, my lord.
  3522  
  3523  Ham.
  3524  I mean, my head upon your lap?
  3525  
  3526  Oph.
  3527  Ay, my lord.
  3528  
  3529  Ham.
  3530  Do you think I meant country matters?
  3531  
  3532  Oph.
  3533  I think nothing, my lord.
  3534  
  3535  Ham.
  3536  That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  3537  
  3538  Oph.
  3539  What is, my lord?

  3545  You are merry, my lord.

  3550  Oph.
  3551  Ay, my lord.
  3552  
  3553  Ham.
  3554  O, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
  3555  for look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
  3556  within 's two hours.
  3557  
  3558  Oph.
  3559  Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  3560  
  3561  Ham.
  3562  So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
  3563  suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
  3564  yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
  3565  half a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or else
  3566  shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose
  3567  epitaph is 'For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

  3575  him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
  3576  crown, kisses it, pours poison in the king's ears, and exit. The
  3577  Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action.
  3578  The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,
  3579  seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The

  3624  [Enter a King and a Queen.]
  3625  
  3626  P. King.
  3627  Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
  3628  Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
  3629  And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
  3630  About the world have times twelve thirties been,
  3631  Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
  3632  Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
  3633  
  3634  P. Queen.
  3635  So many journeys may the sun and moon
  3636  Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
  3637  But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
  3638  So far from cheer and from your former state.
  3639  That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
  3640  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
  3641  For women's fear and love holds quantity;
  3642  In neither aught, or in extremity.
  3643  Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
  3644  And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:
  3645  Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
  3646  Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
  3647  
  3648  P. King.
  3649  Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
  3650  My operant powers their functions leave to do:
  3651  And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
  3652  Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
  3653  For husband shalt thou,--
  3654  
  3655  P. Queen.
  3656  O, confound the rest!
  3657  Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
  3658  In second husband let me be accurst!
  3659  None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
  3660  
  3661  Ham.
  3662  [Aside.] Wormwood, wormwood!
  3663  
  3664  P. Queen.
  3665  The instances that second marriage move
  3666  Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
  3667  A second time I kill my husband dead
  3668  When second husband kisses me in bed.
  3669  
  3670  P. King.
  3671  I do believe you think what now you speak;
  3672  But what we do determine oft we break.
  3673  Purpose is but the slave to memory;
  3674  Of violent birth, but poor validity:
  3675  Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
  3676  But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
  3677  Most necessary 'tis that we forget
  3678  To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
  3679  What to ourselves in passion we propose,
  3680  The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
  3681  The violence of either grief or joy
  3682  Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
  3683  Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
  3684  Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
  3685  This world is not for aye; nor 'tis not strange
  3686  That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
  3687  For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
  3688  Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
  3689  The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
  3690  The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
  3691  And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:
  3692  For who not needs shall never lack a friend;
  3693  And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
  3694  Directly seasons him his enemy.
  3695  But, orderly to end where I begun,--
  3696  Our wills and fates do so contrary run
  3697  That our devices still are overthrown;
  3698  Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
  3699  So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
  3700  But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
  3701  
  3702  P. Queen.
  3703  Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
  3704  Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
  3705  To desperation turn my trust and hope!
  3706  An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
  3707  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  3708  Meet what I would have well, and it destroy!
  3709  Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
  3710  If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
  3711  
  3712  Ham.
  3713  If she should break it now! [To Ophelia.]
  3714  
  3715  P. King.
  3716  'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
  3717  My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
  3718  The tedious day with sleep.
  3719  [Sleeps.]
  3720  
  3721  P. Queen.
  3722  Sleep rock thy brain,
  3723  And never come mischance between us twain!
  3724  
  3725  [Exit.]

  3727  Ham.
  3728  Madam, how like you this play?

  3730  Queen.
  3731  The lady protests too much, methinks.

  3733  Ham.
  3734  O, but she'll keep her word.

  3736  King.
  3737  Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  3738  
  3739  Ham.
  3740  No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the
  3741  world.
  3742  
  3743  King.
  3744  What do you call the play?
  3745  
  3746  Ham.
  3747  The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
  3748  image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name;
  3749  his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of
  3750  work: but what o' that? your majesty, and we that have free
  3751  souls, it touches us not: let the gall'd jade wince; our withers
  3752  are unwrung.

  3875  Guil.
  3876  No, my lord; rather with choler.
  3877

  3879  Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
  3880  the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
  3881  plunge him into far more choler.
  3882

  3898  Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
  3899  If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
  3900  your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return

  3910  Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such
  3911  answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
  3912  my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you
  3913  say,--
  3914  
  3915  Ros.
  3916  Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
  3917  amazement and admiration.

  3921  sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?

  3924  She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.

  3937  Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely,
  3938  bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to
  3939  your friend.

  3941  Ham.
  3942  Sir, I lack advancement.
  3943  
  3944  Ros.
  3945  How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself
  3946  for your succession in Denmark?

  3959  O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.

  3967  Ham.
  3968  I pray you.

  3974  I do beseech you.

  3976  Guil.
  3977  I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  3978  
  3979  Ham.
  3980  'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your
  3981  finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will

  3989  Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
  3990  would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
  3991  pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
  3992  lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,

  4003  My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
  4004  
  4005  Ham.
  4006  Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  4007  
  4008  Pol.
  4009  By the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  4010  
  4011  Ham.
  4012  Methinks it is like a weasel.
  4013  
  4014  Pol.
  4015  It is backed like a weasel.
  4016  
  4017  Ham.
  4018  Or like a whale.
  4019  
  4020  Pol.
  4021  Very like a whale.
  4022  
  4023  Ham.
  4024  Then will I come to my mother by and by.--They fool me to the
  4025  top of my bent.--I will come by and by.
  4026  
  4027  Pol.
  4028  I will say so.
  4029  
  4030  [Exit.]
  4031  
  4032  Ham.
  4033  By-and-by is easily said.

  4036  
  4037  --Leave me, friends.

  4040  
  4041  'Tis now the very witching time of night,
  4042  When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
  4043  Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
  4044  And do such bitter business as the day
  4045  Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.--
  4046  O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
  4047  The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
  4048  Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
  4049  I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
  4050  My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites,--
  4051  How in my words somever she be shent,
  4052  To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

  4058  Scene III. A room in the Castle.
  4059  
  4060  [Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]
  4061  
  4062  King.
  4063  I like him not; nor stands it safe with us
  4064  To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
  4065  I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
  4066  And he to England shall along with you:
  4067  The terms of our estate may not endure
  4068  Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
  4069  Out of his lunacies.
  4070  
  4071  Guil.
  4072  We will ourselves provide:
  4073  Most holy and religious fear it is
  4074  To keep those many many bodies safe
  4075  That live and feed upon your majesty.
  4076  
  4077  Ros.
  4078  The single and peculiar life is bound,
  4079  With all the strength and armour of the mind,
  4080  To keep itself from 'noyance; but much more
  4081  That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
  4082  The lives of many. The cease of majesty
  4083  Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw
  4084  What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
  4085  Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
  4086  To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
  4087  Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
  4088  Each small annexment, petty consequence,
  4089  Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
  4090  Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  4091  
  4092  King.
  4093  Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
  4094  For we will fetters put upon this fear,
  4095  Which now goes too free-footed.
  4096  
  4097  Ros and Guil.
  4098  We will haste us.

  4100  [Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]
  4101  
  4102  [Enter Polonius.]
  4103  
  4104  Pol.
  4105  My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
  4106  Behind the arras I'll convey myself
  4107  To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:
  4108  And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
  4109  'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
  4110  Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
  4111  The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
  4112  I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
  4113  And tell you what I know.
  4114  
  4115  King.
  4116  Thanks, dear my lord.
  4117  
  4118  [Exit Polonius.]
  4119  
  4120  O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
  4121  It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,--
  4122  A brother's murder!--Pray can I not,
  4123  Though inclination be as sharp as will:
  4124  My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
  4125  And, like a man to double business bound,
  4126  I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
  4127  And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
  4128  Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,--
  4129  Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
  4130  To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
  4131  But to confront the visage of offence?
  4132  And what's in prayer but this twofold force,--
  4133  To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
  4134  Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
  4135  My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
  4136  Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!--
  4137  That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
  4138  Of those effects for which I did the murder,--
  4139  My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
  4140  May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
  4141  In the corrupted currents of this world
  4142  Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice;
  4143  And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
  4144  Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above;
  4145  There is no shuffling;--there the action lies
  4146  In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
  4147  Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
  4148  To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
  4149  Try what repentance can: what can it not?
  4150  Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
  4151  O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
  4152  O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
  4153  Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay:
  4154  Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of steel,
  4155  Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
  4156  All may be well.
  4157  
  4158  [Retires and kneels.]
  4159  
  4160  [Enter Hamlet.]
  4161  
  4162  Ham.
  4163  Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
  4164  And now I'll do't;--and so he goes to heaven;
  4165  And so am I reveng'd.--that would be scann'd:
  4166  A villain kills my father; and for that,
  4167  I, his sole son, do this same villain send
  4168  To heaven.
  4169  O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
  4170  He took my father grossly, full of bread;
  4171  With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
  4172  And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
  4173  But in our circumstance and course of thought,
  4174  'Tis heavy with him: and am I, then, reveng'd,
  4175  To take him in the purging of his soul,
  4176  When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
  4177  No.
  4178  Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:
  4179  When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
  4180  Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
  4181  At gaming, swearing; or about some act
  4182  That has no relish of salvation in't;--
  4183  Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven;
  4184  And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
  4185  As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
  4186  This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

  4201  
  4202  [Enter Queen and Polonius.]
  4203  
  4204  Pol.
  4205  He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
  4206  Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
  4207  And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
  4208  Much heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here.
  4209  Pray you, be round with him.
  4210  
  4211  Ham.
  4212  [Within.] Mother, mother, mother!
  4213  
  4214  Queen.
  4215  I'll warrant you:
  4216  Fear me not:--withdraw; I hear him coming.
  4217  
  4218  [Polonius goes behind the arras.]
  4219  
  4220  [Enter Hamlet.]
  4221  
  4222  Ham.
  4223  Now, mother, what's the matter?
  4224  
  4225  Queen.
  4226  Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  4227  
  4228  Ham.
  4229  Mother, you have my father much offended.
  4230  
  4231  Queen.
  4232  Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  4233  
  4234  Ham.
  4235  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  4236  
  4237  Queen.
  4238  Why, how now, Hamlet!
  4239  
  4240  Ham.
  4241  What's the matter now?
  4242  
  4243  Queen.
  4244  Have you forgot me?
  4245  
  4246  Ham.
  4247  No, by the rood, not so:
  4248  You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
  4249  And,--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
  4250  
  4251  Queen.
  4252  Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
  4253  
  4254  Ham.
  4255  Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
  4256  You go not till I set you up a glass
  4257  Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  4258  
  4259  Queen.
  4260  What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?--
  4261  Help, help, ho!
  4262  
  4263  Pol.
  4264  [Behind.] What, ho! help, help, help!
  4265  
  4266  Ham.
  4267  How now? a rat? [Draws.]
  4268  Dead for a ducat, dead!
  4269  
  4270  [Makes a pass through the arras.]
  4271  
  4272  Pol.
  4273  [Behind.] O, I am slain!
  4274  
  4275  [Falls and dies.]
  4276  
  4277  Queen.
  4278  O me, what hast thou done?
  4279  
  4280  Ham.
  4281  Nay, I know not: is it the king?
  4282  
  4283  [Draws forth Polonius.]
  4284  
  4285  Queen.
  4286  O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  4287  
  4288  Ham.
  4289  A bloody deed!--almost as bad, good mother,
  4290  As kill a king and marry with his brother.
  4291  
  4292  Queen.
  4293  As kill a king!
  4294  
  4295  Ham.
  4296  Ay, lady, 'twas my word.--
  4297  Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
  4298  [To Polonius.]
  4299  I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
  4300  Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.--
  4301  Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
  4302  And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,
  4303  If it be made of penetrable stuff;
  4304  If damned custom have not braz'd it so
  4305  That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  4306  
  4307  Queen.
  4308  What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
  4309  In noise so rude against me?
  4310  
  4311  Ham.
  4312  Such an act
  4313  That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
  4314  Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
  4315  From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
  4316  And sets a blister there; makes marriage-vows
  4317  As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
  4318  As from the body of contraction plucks
  4319  The very soul, and sweet religion makes
  4320  A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;
  4321  Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
  4322  With tristful visage, as against the doom,
  4323  Is thought-sick at the act.
  4324  
  4325  Queen.
  4326  Ah me, what act,
  4327  That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
  4328  
  4329  Ham.
  4330  Look here upon this picture, and on this,--
  4331  The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
  4332  See what a grace was seated on this brow;
  4333  Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
  4334  An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
  4335  A station like the herald Mercury
  4336  New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
  4337  A combination and a form, indeed,
  4338  Where every god did seem to set his seal,
  4339  To give the world assurance of a man;
  4340  This was your husband.--Look you now what follows:
  4341  Here is your husband, like a milldew'd ear
  4342  Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
  4343  Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
  4344  And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
  4345  You cannot call it love; for at your age
  4346  The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
  4347  And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
  4348  Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
  4349  Else could you not have motion: but sure that sense
  4350  Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err;
  4351  Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
  4352  But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
  4353  To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
  4354  That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
  4355  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  4356  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  4357  Or but a sickly part of one true sense
  4358  Could not so mope.
  4359  O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
  4360  If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
  4361  To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
  4362  And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
  4363  When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
  4364  Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
  4365  And reason panders will.
  4366  
  4367  Queen.
  4368  O Hamlet, speak no more:
  4369  Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
  4370  And there I see such black and grained spots
  4371  As will not leave their tinct.
  4372  
  4373  Ham.
  4374  Nay, but to live
  4375  In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
  4376  Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
  4377  Over the nasty sty,--
  4378  
  4379  Queen.
  4380  O, speak to me no more;
  4381  These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
  4382  No more, sweet Hamlet.
  4383  
  4384  Ham.
  4385  A murderer and a villain;
  4386  A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
  4387  Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
  4388  A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
  4389  That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
  4390  And put it in his pocket!
  4391  
  4392  Queen.
  4393  No more.
  4394  
  4395  Ham.
  4396  A king of shreds and patches!--
  4397  
  4398  [Enter Ghost.]
  4399  
  4400  Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
  4401  You heavenly guards!--What would your gracious figure?
  4402  
  4403  Queen.
  4404  Alas, he's mad!
  4405  
  4406  Ham.
  4407  Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
  4408  That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
  4409  The important acting of your dread command?
  4410  O, say!
  4411  
  4412  Ghost.
  4413  Do not forget. This visitation
  4414  Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
  4415  But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
  4416  O, step between her and her fighting soul,--
  4417  Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works,--
  4418  Speak to her, Hamlet.
  4419  
  4420  Ham.
  4421  How is it with you, lady?
  4422  
  4423  Queen.
  4424  Alas, how is't with you,
  4425  That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
  4426  And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
  4427  Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
  4428  And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
  4429  Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
  4430  Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
  4431  Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
  4432  Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  4433  
  4434  Ham.
  4435  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  4436  His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
  4437  Would make them capable.--Do not look upon me;
  4438  Lest with this piteous action you convert
  4439  My stern effects: then what I have to do
  4440  Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
  4441  
  4442  Queen.
  4443  To whom do you speak this?
  4444  
  4445  Ham.
  4446  Do you see nothing there?
  4447  
  4448  Queen.
  4449  Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  4450  
  4451  Ham.
  4452  Nor did you nothing hear?
  4453  
  4454  Queen.
  4455  No, nothing but ourselves.
  4456  
  4457  Ham.
  4458  Why, look you there! look how it steals away!
  4459  My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
  4460  Look, where he goes, even now out at the portal!
  4461  
  4462  [Exit Ghost.]
  4463  
  4464  Queen.
  4465  This is the very coinage of your brain:
  4466  This bodiless creation ecstasy
  4467  Is very cunning in.
  4468  
  4469  Ham.
  4470  Ecstasy!
  4471  My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
  4472  And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
  4473  That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
  4474  And I the matter will re-word; which madness
  4475  Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
  4476  Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
  4477  That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
  4478  It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
  4479  Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
  4480  Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
  4481  Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
  4482  And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
  4483  To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
  4484  For in the fatness of these pursy times
  4485  Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
  4486  Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  4487  
  4488  Queen.
  4489  O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  4490  
  4491  Ham.
  4492  O, throw away the worser part of it,
  4493  And live the purer with the other half.
  4494  Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
  4495  Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
  4496  That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
  4497  Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,--
  4498  That to the use of actions fair and good
  4499  He likewise gives a frock or livery
  4500  That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
  4501  And that shall lend a kind of easiness
  4502  To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
  4503  For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
  4504  And either curb the devil, or throw him out
  4505  With wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:
  4506  And when you are desirous to be bles'd,
  4507  I'll blessing beg of you.--For this same lord

  4509  I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
  4510  To punish me with this, and this with me,
  4511  That I must be their scourge and minister.
  4512  I will bestow him, and will answer well
  4513  The death I gave him. So again, good-night.--
  4514  I must be cruel, only to be kind:
  4515  Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.--
  4516  One word more, good lady.
  4517  
  4518  Queen.
  4519  What shall I do?
  4520  
  4521  Ham.
  4522  Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
  4523  Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
  4524  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  4525  And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
  4526  Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
  4527  Make you to ravel all this matter out,
  4528  That I essentially am not in madness,
  4529  But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
  4530  For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
  4531  Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
  4532  Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
  4533  No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
  4534  Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
  4535  Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
  4536  To try conclusions, in the basket creep
  4537  And break your own neck down.
  4538  
  4539  Queen.
  4540  Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
  4541  And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
  4542  What thou hast said to me.
  4543  
  4544  Ham.
  4545  I must to England; you know that?
  4546  
  4547  Queen.
  4548  Alack,
  4549  I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
  4550  
  4551  Ham.
  4552  There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,--
  4553  Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,--
  4554  They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
  4555  And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
  4556  For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
  4557  Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
  4558  But I will delve one yard below their mines
  4559  And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
  4560  When in one line two crafts directly meet.--
  4561  This man shall set me packing:
  4562  I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.--
  4563  Mother, good-night.--Indeed, this counsellor
  4564  Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
  4565  Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
  4566  Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you:--
  4567  Good night, mother.

  4573  ACT IV.
  4574  
  4575  Scene I. A room in the Castle.
  4576  
  4577  [Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
  4578  
  4579  King.
  4580  There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
  4581  You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
  4582  Where is your son?
  4583  
  4584  Queen.
  4585  Bestow this place on us a little while.
  4586  
  4587  [To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out.]
  4588  
  4589  Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
  4590  
  4591  King.
  4592  What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  4593  
  4594  Queen.
  4595  Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
  4596  Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit
  4597  Behind the arras hearing something stir,
  4598  Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
  4599  And in this brainish apprehension, kills
  4600  The unseen good old man.
  4601  
  4602  King.
  4603  O heavy deed!
  4604  It had been so with us, had we been there:
  4605  His liberty is full of threats to all;
  4606  To you yourself, to us, to every one.
  4607  Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
  4608  It will be laid to us, whose providence
  4609  Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
  4610  This mad young man. But so much was our love
  4611  We would not understand what was most fit;
  4612  But, like the owner of a foul disease,
  4613  To keep it from divulging, let it feed
  4614  Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  4615  
  4616  Queen.
  4617  To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
  4618  O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
  4619  Among a mineral of metals base,
  4620  Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.
  4621  
  4622  King.
  4623  O Gertrude, come away!
  4624  The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
  4625  But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
  4626  We must with all our majesty and skill
  4627  Both countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!
  4628  
  4629  [Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
  4630  
  4631  Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
  4632  Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
  4633  And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
  4634  Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
  4635  Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
  4636  
  4637  [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
  4638  
  4639  Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
  4640  And let them know both what we mean to do
  4641  And what's untimely done: so haply slander,--
  4642  Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
  4643  As level as the cannon to his blank,
  4644  Transports his poison'd shot,--may miss our name,
  4645  And hit the woundless air.--O, come away!
  4646  My soul is full of discord and dismay.
  4647  
  4648  [Exeunt.]
  4649  
  4650  Scene II. Another room in the Castle.

  4657  Ros. and Guil.
  4658  [Within.] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  4659  
  4660  Ham.
  4661  What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
  4662  
  4663  [Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
  4664  
  4665  Ros.
  4666  What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  4667  
  4668  Ham.
  4669  Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  4670  
  4671  Ros.
  4672  Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
  4673  And bear it to the chapel.
  4674  
  4675  Ham.
  4676  Do not believe it.
  4677  
  4678  Ros.
  4679  Believe what?
  4680  
  4681  Ham.
  4682  That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
  4683  demanded of a sponge!--what replication should be made by the son
  4684  of a king?
  4685  
  4686  Ros.
  4687  Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  4688  
  4689  Ham.
  4690  Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
  4691  his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in
  4692  the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
  4693  first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
  4694  gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry
  4695  again.
  4696  
  4697  Ros.
  4698  I understand you not, my lord.
  4699  
  4700  Ham.
  4701  I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  4702  
  4703  Ros.
  4704  My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
  4705  the king.
  4706  
  4707  Ham.
  4708  The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
  4709  The king is a thing,--
  4710  
  4711  Guil.
  4712  A thing, my lord!
  4713  
  4714  Ham.
  4715  Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

  4721  Scene III. Another room in the Castle.
  4722  
  4723  [Enter King,attended.]
  4724  
  4725  King.
  4726  I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
  4727  How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
  4728  Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
  4729  He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
  4730  Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
  4731  And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
  4732  But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
  4733  This sudden sending him away must seem
  4734  Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
  4735  By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
  4736  Or not at all.
  4737  
  4738  [Enter Rosencrantz.]
  4739  
  4740  How now! what hath befall'n?
  4741  
  4742  Ros.
  4743  Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
  4744  We cannot get from him.
  4745  
  4746  King.
  4747  But where is he?
  4748  
  4749  Ros.
  4750  Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  4751  
  4752  King.
  4753  Bring him before us.
  4754  
  4755  Ros.
  4756  Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
  4757  
  4758  [Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.]
  4759  
  4760  King.
  4761  Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  4762  
  4763  Ham.
  4764  At supper.
  4765  
  4766  King.
  4767  At supper! where?
  4768  
  4769  Ham.
  4770  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
  4771  convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
  4772  only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and
  4773  we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar
  4774  is but variable service,--two dishes, but to one table: that's
  4775  the end.
  4776  
  4777  King.
  4778  Alas, alas!
  4779  
  4780  Ham.
  4781  A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
  4782  of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  4783  
  4784  King.
  4785  What dost thou mean by this?
  4786  
  4787  Ham.
  4788  Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
  4789  the guts of a beggar.
  4790  
  4791  King.
  4792  Where is Polonius?
  4793  
  4794  Ham.
  4795  In heaven: send thither to see: if your messenger find him not
  4796  there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you
  4797  find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
  4798  the stairs into the lobby.
  4799  
  4800  King.
  4801  Go seek him there. [To some Attendants.]
  4802  
  4803  Ham.
  4804  He will stay till you come.
  4805  
  4806  [Exeunt Attendants.]
  4807  
  4808  King.
  4809  Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
  4810  Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
  4811  For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
  4812  With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
  4813  The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
  4814  The associates tend, and everything is bent
  4815  For England.
  4816  
  4817  Ham.
  4818  For England!
  4819  
  4820  King.
  4821  Ay, Hamlet.
  4822  
  4823  Ham.
  4824  Good.
  4825  
  4826  King.
  4827  So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  4828  
  4829  Ham.
  4830  I see a cherub that sees them.--But, come; for England!--
  4831  Farewell, dear mother.
  4832  
  4833  King.
  4834  Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  4835  
  4836  Ham.
  4837  My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
  4838  one flesh; and so, my mother.--Come, for England!
  4839  
  4840  [Exit.]
  4841  
  4842  King.
  4843  Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
  4844  Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
  4845  Away! for everything is seal'd and done
  4846  That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
  4847  
  4848  [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
  4849  
  4850  And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,--
  4851  As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
  4852  Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
  4853  After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
  4854  Pays homage to us,--thou mayst not coldly set
  4855  Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
  4856  By letters conjuring to that effect,
  4857  The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
  4858  For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
  4859  And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
  4860  Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

  4870  For.
  4871  Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king:
  4872  Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras
  4873  Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
  4874  Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
  4875  If that his majesty would aught with us,
  4876  We shall express our duty in his eye;
  4877  And let him know so.
  4878  
  4879  Capt.
  4880  I will do't, my lord.
  4881  
  4882  For.
  4883  Go softly on.

  4890  Good sir, whose powers are these?
  4891  
  4892  Capt.
  4893  They are of Norway, sir.
  4894  
  4895  Ham.
  4896  How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  4897  
  4898  Capt.
  4899  Against some part of Poland.
  4900  
  4901  Ham.
  4902  Who commands them, sir?
  4903  
  4904  Capt.
  4905  The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  4906  
  4907  Ham.
  4908  Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
  4909  Or for some frontier?
  4910  
  4911  Capt.
  4912  Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  4913  We go to gain a little patch of ground
  4914  That hath in it no profit but the name.
  4915  To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
  4916  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  4917  A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  4918  
  4919  Ham.
  4920  Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  4921  
  4922  Capt.
  4923  Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  4924  
  4925  Ham.
  4926  Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
  4927  Will not debate the question of this straw:
  4928  This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
  4929  That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
  4930  Why the man dies.--I humbly thank you, sir.
  4931  
  4932  Capt.
  4933  God b' wi' you, sir.
  4934  
  4935  [Exit.]
  4936  
  4937  Ros.
  4938  Will't please you go, my lord?
  4939  
  4940  Ham.
  4941  I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
  4942  
  4943  [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
  4944  
  4945  How all occasions do inform against me
  4946  And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
  4947  If his chief good and market of his time
  4948  Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
  4949  Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
  4950  Looking before and after, gave us not
  4951  That capability and godlike reason
  4952  To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
  4953  Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
  4954  Of thinking too precisely on the event,--
  4955  A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
  4956  And ever three parts coward,--I do not know
  4957  Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
  4958  Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
  4959  To do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:
  4960  Witness this army, of such mass and charge,
  4961  Led by a delicate and tender prince;
  4962  Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
  4963  Makes mouths at the invisible event;
  4964  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  4965  To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
  4966  Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
  4967  Is not to stir without great argument,
  4968  But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
  4969  When honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,
  4970  That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
  4971  Excitements of my reason and my blood,
  4972  And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
  4973  The imminent death of twenty thousand men
  4974  That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
  4975  Go to their graves like beds; fight for a plot
  4976  Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
  4977  Which is not tomb enough and continent
  4978  To hide the slain?--O, from this time forth,
  4979  My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

  4989  Queen.
  4990  I will not speak with her.

  4992  Gent.
  4993  She is importunate; indeed distract:
  4994  Her mood will needs be pitied.
  4995  
  4996  Queen.
  4997  What would she have?
  4998  
  4999  Gent.
  5000  She speaks much of her father; says she hears
  5001  There's tricks i' the world, and hems, and beats her heart;
  5002  Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
  5003  That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
  5004  Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
  5005  The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
  5006  And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
  5007  Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
  5008  Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
  5009  Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  5010  'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
  5011  Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

  5017  
  5018  To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,

  5028  Queen.
  5029  How now, Ophelia?
  5030  
  5031  Oph. [Sings.]
  5032     How should I your true love know
  5033       From another one?
  5034     By his cockle bat and' staff
  5035       And his sandal shoon.
  5036  
  5037  Queen.
  5038  Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  5039  
  5040  Oph.
  5041  Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
  5042  [Sings.]
  5043     He is dead and gone, lady,
  5044       He is dead and gone;
  5045     At his head a grass green turf,
  5046       At his heels a stone.
  5047  
  5048  Queen.
  5049  Nay, but Ophelia--
  5050  
  5051  Oph.
  5052  Pray you, mark.
  5053  [Sings.]
  5054     White his shroud as the mountain snow,
  5055  
  5056  [Enter King.]
  5057  
  5058  Queen.
  5059  Alas, look here, my lord!
  5060  
  5061  Oph.
  5062  [Sings.]
  5063       Larded all with sweet flowers;
  5064     Which bewept to the grave did go
  5065       With true-love showers.
  5066  
  5067  King.
  5068  How do you, pretty lady?
  5069  
  5070  Oph.
  5071  Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
  5072  Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
  5073  your table!
  5074  
  5075  King.
  5076  Conceit upon her father.
  5077  
  5078  Oph.
  5079  Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what
  5080  it means, say you this:
  5081  [Sings.]
  5082     To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day
  5083       All in the morning bedtime,
  5084     And I a maid at your window,
  5085       To be your Valentine.
  5086  
  5087     Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,
  5088       And dupp'd the chamber door,
  5089     Let in the maid, that out a maid
  5090       Never departed more.
  5091  
  5092  King.
  5093  Pretty Ophelia!
  5094  
  5095  Oph.
  5096  Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
  5097  [Sings.]
  5098     By Gis and by Saint Charity,
  5099       Alack, and fie for shame!
  5100     Young men will do't if they come to't;
  5101       By cock, they are to blame.
  5102  
  5103     Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
  5104       You promis'd me to wed.
  5105     So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
  5106       An thou hadst not come to my bed.
  5107  
  5108  King.
  5109  How long hath she been thus?
  5110  
  5111  Oph.
  5112  I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot
  5113  choose but weep, to think they would lay him i' the cold ground.
  5114  My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good
  5115  counsel.--Come, my coach!--Good night, ladies; good night, sweet
  5116  ladies; good night, good night.
  5117  
  5118  [Exit.]
  5119  
  5120  King.
  5121  Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
  5122  
  5123  [Exit Horatio.]
  5124  
  5125  O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
  5126  All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
  5127  When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
  5128  But in battalions! First, her father slain:
  5129  Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
  5130  Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
  5131  Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
  5132  For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly
  5133  In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
  5134  Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
  5135  Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts:
  5136  Last, and as much containing as all these,
  5137  Her brother is in secret come from France;
  5138  Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
  5139  And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
  5140  With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
  5141  Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
  5142  Will nothing stick our person to arraign
  5143  In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
  5144  Like to a murdering piece, in many places
  5145  Give, me superfluous death.
  5146  
  5147  [A noise within.]
  5148  
  5149  Queen.
  5150  Alack, what noise is this?
  5151  
  5152  King.
  5153  Where are my Switzers? let them guard the door.
  5154  
  5155  [Enter a Gentleman.]
  5156  
  5157  What is the matter?
  5158  
  5159  Gent.
  5160  Save yourself, my lord:
  5161  The ocean, overpeering of his list,
  5162  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  5163  Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
  5164  O'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord;
  5165  And, as the world were now but to begin,
  5166  Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
  5167  The ratifiers and props of every word,
  5168  They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
  5169  Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
  5170  'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
  5171  
  5172  Queen.
  5173  How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
  5174  O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  5175  
  5176  [A noise within.]
  5177  
  5178  King.
  5179  The doors are broke.
  5180  
  5181  [Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.]
  5182  
  5183  Laer.
  5184  Where is this king?--Sirs, stand you all without.
  5185  
  5186  Danes.
  5187  No, let's come in.
  5188  
  5189  Laer.
  5190  I pray you, give me leave.
  5191  
  5192  Danes.
  5193  We will, we will.
  5194  
  5195  [They retire without the door.]
  5196  
  5197  Laer.
  5198  I thank you:--keep the door.--O thou vile king,
  5199  Give me my father!
  5200  
  5201  Queen.
  5202  Calmly, good Laertes.
  5203  
  5204  Laer.
  5205  That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
  5206  Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
  5207  Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
  5208  Of my true mother.
  5209  
  5210  King.
  5211  What is the cause, Laertes,
  5212  That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?--
  5213  Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
  5214  There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
  5215  That treason can but peep to what it would,
  5216  Acts little of his will.--Tell me, Laertes,
  5217  Why thou art thus incens'd.--Let him go, Gertrude:--
  5218  Speak, man.
  5219  
  5220  Laer.
  5221  Where is my father?
  5222  
  5223  King.
  5224  Dead.
  5225  
  5226  Queen.
  5227  But not by him.
  5228  
  5229  King.
  5230  Let him demand his fill.
  5231  
  5232  Laer.
  5233  How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
  5234  To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
  5235  Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
  5236  I dare damnation:--to this point I stand,--
  5237  That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
  5238  Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
  5239  Most throughly for my father.
  5240  
  5241  King.
  5242  Who shall stay you?
  5243  
  5244  Laer.
  5245  My will, not all the world:
  5246  And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
  5247  They shall go far with little.
  5248  
  5249  King.
  5250  Good Laertes,
  5251  If you desire to know the certainty
  5252  Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
  5253  That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
  5254  Winner and loser?
  5255  
  5256  Laer.
  5257  None but his enemies.
  5258  
  5259  King.
  5260  Will you know them then?
  5261  
  5262  Laer.
  5263  To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
  5264  And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,
  5265  Repast them with my blood.
  5266  
  5267  King.
  5268  Why, now you speak
  5269  Like a good child and a true gentleman.
  5270  That I am guiltless of your father's death,
  5271  And am most sensibly in grief for it,
  5272  It shall as level to your judgment pierce
  5273  As day does to your eye.
  5274  
  5275  Danes.
  5276  [Within] Let her come in.
  5277  
  5278  Laer.
  5279  How now! What noise is that?
  5280  
  5281  [Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and
  5282  flowers.]
  5283  
  5284  O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
  5285  Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!--
  5286  By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
  5287  Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
  5288  Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!--
  5289  O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
  5290  Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
  5291  Nature is fine in love; and where 'tis fine,
  5292  It sends some precious instance of itself
  5293  After the thing it loves.
  5294  
  5295  Oph.
  5296  [Sings.]
  5297     They bore him barefac'd on the bier
  5298     Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny
  5299     And on his grave rain'd many a tear.--
  5300  
  5301  Fare you well, my dove!
  5302  
  5303  Laer.
  5304  Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
  5305  It could not move thus.
  5306  
  5307  Oph.
  5308  You must sing 'Down a-down, an you call him a-down-a.' O,
  5309  how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
  5310  master's daughter.
  5311  
  5312  Laer.
  5313  This nothing's more than matter.
  5314  
  5315  Oph.
  5316  There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love,
  5317  remember: and there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  5318  
  5319  Laer.
  5320  A document in madness,--thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  5321  
  5322  Oph.
  5323  There's fennel for you, and columbines:--there's rue for you;
  5324  and here's some for me:--we may call it herb of grace o'
  5325  Sundays:--O, you must wear your rue with a difference.--There's a
  5326  daisy:--I would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when
  5327  my father died:--they say he made a good end,--

  5337     And will he not come again?
  5338     And will he not come again?
  5339       No, no, he is dead,
  5340       Go to thy death-bed,
  5341     He never will come again.
  5342  
  5343     His beard was as white as snow,
  5344     All flaxen was his poll:
  5345       He is gone, he is gone,
  5346       And we cast away moan:
  5347     God ha' mercy on his soul!
  5348  
  5349  And of all Christian souls, I pray God.--God b' wi' ye.
  5350

  5353  Laer.
  5354  Do you see this, O God?
  5355  
  5356  King.
  5357  Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
  5358  Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
  5359  Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
  5360  And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
  5361  If by direct or by collateral hand
  5362  They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
  5363  Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
  5364  To you in satisfaction; but if not,
  5365  Be you content to lend your patience to us,
  5366  And we shall jointly labour with your soul
  5367  To give it due content.

  5370  Let this be so;
  5371  His means of death, his obscure burial,--
  5372  No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
  5373  No noble rite nor formal ostentation,--
  5374  Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
  5375  That I must call't in question.
  5376

  5414  sir,--it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if
  5415  your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  5416  
  5417  Hor.
  5418  [Reads.] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
  5419  this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have
  5420  letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
  5421  very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
  5422  slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
  5423  boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
  5424  alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
  5425  of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for
  5426  them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou
  5427  to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
  5428  to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
  5429  light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
  5430  thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
  5431  for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
  5432  He that thou knowest thine,       HAMLET.'
  5433  
  5434  Come, I will give you way for these your letters;
  5435  And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
  5436  To him from whom you brought them.

  5443  
  5444  [Enter King and Laertes.]
  5445  
  5446  King.
  5447  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  5448  And you must put me in your heart for friend,
  5449  Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
  5450  That he which hath your noble father slain
  5451  Pursu'd my life.
  5452  
  5453  Laer.
  5454  It well appears:--but tell me
  5455  Why you proceeded not against these feats,
  5456  So crimeful and so capital in nature,
  5457  As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
  5458  You mainly were stirr'd up.
  5459  
  5460  King.
  5461  O, for two special reasons;
  5462  Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
  5463  But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
  5464  Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,--
  5465  My virtue or my plague, be it either which,--
  5466  She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
  5467  That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
  5468  I could not but by her. The other motive,
  5469  Why to a public count I might not go,
  5470  Is the great love the general gender bear him;
  5471  Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
  5472  Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
  5473  Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
  5474  Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
  5475  Would have reverted to my bow again,
  5476  And not where I had aim'd them.
  5477  
  5478  Laer.
  5479  And so have I a noble father lost;
  5480  A sister driven into desperate terms,--
  5481  Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
  5482  Stood challenger on mount of all the age
  5483  For her perfections:--but my revenge will come.
  5484  
  5485  King.
  5486  Break not your sleeps for that:--you must not think
  5487  That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
  5488  That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
  5489  And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
  5490  I lov'd your father, and we love ourself;
  5491  And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine,--
  5492

  5535  'Thus didest thou.'
  5536  
  5537  King.
  5538  If it be so, Laertes,--
  5539  As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
  5540  Will you be rul'd by me?
  5541  
  5542  Laer.
  5543  Ay, my lord;
  5544  So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  5545  
  5546  King.
  5547  To thine own peace. If he be now return'd--
  5548  As checking at his voyage, and that he means
  5549  No more to undertake it,--I will work him
  5550  To exploit, now ripe in my device,
  5551  Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
  5552  And for his death no wind shall breathe;
  5553  But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
  5554  And call it accident.
  5555  
  5556  Laer.
  5557  My lord, I will be rul'd;
  5558  The rather if you could devise it so
  5559  That I might be the organ.
  5560  
  5561  King.
  5562  It falls right.
  5563  You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
  5564  And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
  5565  Wherein they say you shine: your sum of parts
  5566  Did not together pluck such envy from him
  5567  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  5568  Of the unworthiest siege.
  5569  
  5570  Laer.
  5571  What part is that, my lord?
  5572  
  5573  King.
  5574  A very riband in the cap of youth,
  5575  Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
  5576  The light and careless livery that it wears
  5577  Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
  5578  Importing health and graveness.--Two months since,
  5579  Here was a gentleman of Normandy,--
  5580  I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
  5581  And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
  5582  Had witchcraft in't: he grew unto his seat;
  5583  And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
  5584  As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
  5585  With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought
  5586  That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  5587  Come short of what he did.
  5588  
  5589  Laer.
  5590  A Norman was't?
  5591  
  5592  King.
  5593  A Norman.
  5594  
  5595  Laer.
  5596  Upon my life, Lamond.
  5597  
  5598  King.
  5599  The very same.
  5600  
  5601  Laer.
  5602  I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
  5603  And gem of all the nation.
  5604  
  5605  King.
  5606  He made confession of you;
  5607  And gave you such a masterly report
  5608  For art and exercise in your defence,
  5609  And for your rapier most especially,
  5610  That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed
  5611  If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation
  5612  He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
  5613  If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
  5614  Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
  5615  That he could nothing do but wish and beg
  5616  Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
  5617  Now, out of this,--
  5618  
  5619  Laer.
  5620  What out of this, my lord?
  5621  
  5622  King.
  5623  Laertes, was your father dear to you?
  5624  Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
  5625  A face without a heart?
  5626  
  5627  Laer.
  5628  Why ask you this?
  5629  
  5630  King.
  5631  Not that I think you did not love your father;
  5632  But that I know love is begun by time,
  5633  And that I see, in passages of proof,
  5634  Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
  5635  There lives within the very flame of love
  5636  A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
  5637  And nothing is at a like goodness still;
  5638  For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
  5639  Dies in his own too much: that we would do,
  5640  We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
  5641  And hath abatements and delays as many
  5642  As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
  5643  And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
  5644  That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer:--
  5645  Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake
  5646  To show yourself your father's son in deed
  5647  More than in words?
  5648  
  5649  Laer.
  5650  To cut his throat i' the church.
  5651  
  5652  King.
  5653  No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
  5654  Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
  5655  Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
  5656  Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
  5657  We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
  5658  And set a double varnish on the fame
  5659  The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
  5660  And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
  5661  Most generous, and free from all contriving,
  5662  Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
  5663  Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
  5664  A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
  5665  Requite him for your father.
  5666  
  5667  Laer.
  5668  I will do't:
  5669  And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
  5670  I bought an unction of a mountebank,
  5671  So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
  5672  Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
  5673  Collected from all simples that have virtue
  5674  Under the moon, can save the thing from death
  5675  This is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
  5676  With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
  5677  It may be death.
  5678  
  5679  King.
  5680  Let's further think of this;
  5681  Weigh what convenience both of time and means
  5682  May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
  5683  And that our drift look through our bad performance.
  5684  'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
  5685  Should have a back or second, that might hold
  5686  If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see:--
  5687  We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,--
  5688  I ha't:
  5689  When in your motion you are hot and dry,--
  5690  As make your bouts more violent to that end,--
  5691  And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
  5692  A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
  5693  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
  5694  Our purpose may hold there.
  5695  
  5696  [Enter Queen.]
  5697  
  5698  How now, sweet queen!
  5699  
  5700  Queen.
  5701  One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
  5702  So fast they follow:--your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  5703  
  5704  Laer.
  5705  Drown'd! O, where?
  5706  
  5707  Queen.
  5708  There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
  5709  That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
  5710  There with fantastic garlands did she come
  5711  Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
  5712  That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
  5713  But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
  5714  There, on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
  5715  Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke;
  5716  When down her weedy trophies and herself
  5717  Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
  5718  And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
  5719  Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes;
  5720  As one incapable of her own distress,
  5721  Or like a creature native and indu'd
  5722  Unto that element: but long it could not be
  5723  Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
  5724  Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
  5725  To muddy death.
  5726  
  5727  Laer.
  5728  Alas, then she is drown'd?
  5729  
  5730  Queen.
  5731  Drown'd, drown'd.
  5732  
  5733  Laer.
  5734  Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
  5735  And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
  5736  It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
  5737  Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
  5738  The woman will be out.--Adieu, my lord:
  5739  I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
  5740  But that this folly douts it.
  5741  
  5742  [Exit.]
  5743  
  5744  King.
  5745  Let's follow, Gertrude;
  5746  How much I had to do to calm his rage!
  5747  Now fear I this will give it start again;
  5748  Therefore let's follow.
  5749  
  5750  [Exeunt.]
  5751  
  5752  
  5753  
  5754  ACT V.
  5755  
  5756  Scene I. A churchyard.
  5757  
  5758  [Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c.]
  5759  
  5760  1 Clown.
  5761  Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
  5762  seeks her own salvation?
  5763  
  5764  2 Clown.
  5765  I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the
  5766  crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  5767  
  5768  1 Clown.
  5769  How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?
  5770  
  5771  2 Clown.
  5772  Why, 'tis found so.
  5773  
  5774  1 Clown.
  5775  It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
  5776  the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an
  5777  act hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:
  5778  argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
  5779  
  5780  2 Clown.
  5781  Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
  5782  
  5783  1 Clown.
  5784  Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the
  5785  man; good: if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
  5786  will he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that: but if the water come
  5787  to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is
  5788  not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  5789  
  5790  2 Clown.
  5791  But is this law?
  5792  
  5793  1 Clown.
  5794  Ay, marry, is't--crowner's quest law.
  5795  
  5796  2 Clown.
  5797  Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a
  5798  gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
  5799  
  5800  1 Clown.
  5801  Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk
  5802  should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves
  5803  more than their even Christian.--Come, my spade. There is no
  5804  ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they
  5805  hold up Adam's profession.
  5806  
  5807  2 Clown.
  5808  Was he a gentleman?
  5809  
  5810  1 Clown.
  5811  He was the first that ever bore arms.
  5812  
  5813  2 Clown.
  5814  Why, he had none.
  5815  
  5816  1 Clown.
  5817  What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
  5818  The Scripture says Adam digg'd: could he dig without arms? I'll
  5819  put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
  5820  purpose, confess thyself,--
  5821  
  5822  2 Clown.
  5823  Go to.
  5824  
  5825  1 Clown.
  5826  What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
  5827  shipwright, or the carpenter?
  5828  
  5829  2 Clown.
  5830  The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
  5831  
  5832  1 Clown.
  5833  I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;
  5834  but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now,
  5835  thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
  5836  church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
  5837  
  5838  2 Clown.
  5839  Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
  5840  
  5841  1 Clown.
  5842  Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  5843  
  5844  2 Clown.
  5845  Marry, now I can tell.
  5846  
  5847  1 Clown.
  5848  To't.
  5849  
  5850  2 Clown.
  5851  Mass, I cannot tell.
  5852  
  5853  [Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.]
  5854  
  5855  1 Clown.
  5856  Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
  5857  not mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this
  5858  question next, say 'a grave-maker;' the houses he makes last
  5859  till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
  5860  liquor.
  5861  
  5862  [Exit Second Clown.]
  5863  
  5864  [Digs and sings.]
  5865  
  5866     In youth when I did love, did love,
  5867       Methought it was very sweet;
  5868     To contract, O, the time for, ah, my behove,
  5869       O, methought there was nothing meet.
  5870  
  5871  Ham.
  5872  Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
  5873  grave-making?
  5874  
  5875  Hor.
  5876  Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  5877  
  5878  Ham.
  5879  'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier
  5880  sense.
  5881  
  5882  1 Clown.
  5883  [Sings.]
  5884     But age, with his stealing steps,
  5885       Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
  5886     And hath shipp'd me into the land,
  5887       As if I had never been such.
  5888  
  5889  [Throws up a skull.]
  5890  
  5891  Ham.
  5892  That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the
  5893  knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
  5894  did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician,
  5895  which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
  5896  might it not?
  5897  
  5898  Hor.
  5899  It might, my lord.
  5900  
  5901  Ham.
  5902  Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
  5903  How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that
  5904  praised my lord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg
  5905  it,--might it not?
  5906  
  5907  Hor.
  5908  Ay, my lord.
  5909  
  5910  Ham.
  5911  Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked
  5912  about the mazard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution,
  5913  an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
  5914  breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? mine ache to think
  5915  on't.
  5916  
  5917  1 Clown.
  5918  [Sings.]
  5919     A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
  5920       For and a shrouding sheet;
  5921     O, a pit of clay for to be made
  5922       For such a guest is meet.
  5923  
  5924  [Throws up another skull].
  5925  
  5926  Ham.
  5927  There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
  5928  Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
  5929  and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
  5930  him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
  5931  of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
  5932  great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
  5933  fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of
  5934  his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
  5935  pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of
  5936  his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
  5937  of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
  5938  scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no
  5939  more, ha?
  5940  
  5941  Hor.
  5942  Not a jot more, my lord.
  5943  
  5944  Ham.
  5945  Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?
  5946  
  5947  Hor.
  5948  Ay, my lord, And of calf-skins too.
  5949  
  5950  Ham.
  5951  They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
  5952  will speak to this fellow.--Whose grave's this, sir?
  5953  
  5954  1 Clown.
  5955  Mine, sir.
  5956  [Sings.]
  5957     O, a pit of clay for to be made
  5958       For such a guest is meet.
  5959  
  5960  Ham.
  5961  I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  5962  
  5963  1 Clown.
  5964  You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part,
  5965  I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  5966  
  5967  Ham.
  5968  Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for
  5969  the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  5970  
  5971  1 Clown.
  5972  'Tis a quick lie, sir; 't will away again from me to you.
  5973  
  5974  Ham.
  5975  What man dost thou dig it for?
  5976  
  5977  1 Clown.
  5978  For no man, sir.
  5979  
  5980  Ham.
  5981  What woman then?
  5982  
  5983  1 Clown.
  5984  For none neither.
  5985  
  5986  Ham.
  5987  Who is to be buried in't?
  5988  
  5989  1 Clown.
  5990  One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
  5991  
  5992  Ham.
  5993  How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
  5994  equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three
  5995  years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that
  5996  the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
  5997  galls his kibe.--How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  5998  
  5999  1 Clown.
  6000  Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our
  6001  last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  6002  
  6003  Ham.
  6004  How long is that since?
  6005  
  6006  1 Clown.
  6007  Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the
  6008  very day that young Hamlet was born,--he that is mad, and sent
  6009  into England.
  6010  
  6011  Ham.
  6012  Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  6013  
  6014  1 Clown.
  6015  Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;
  6016  or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
  6017  
  6018  Ham.
  6019  Why?
  6020  
  6021  1 Clown.
  6022  'Twill not he seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.
  6023  
  6024  Ham.
  6025  How came he mad?
  6026  
  6027  1 Clown.
  6028  Very strangely, they say.
  6029  
  6030  Ham.
  6031  How strangely?
  6032  
  6033  1 Clown.
  6034  Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  6035  
  6036  Ham.
  6037  Upon what ground?
  6038  
  6039  1 Clown.
  6040  Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy,
  6041  thirty years.
  6042  
  6043  Ham.
  6044  How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
  6045  
  6046  1 Clown.
  6047  Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,--as we have many
  6048  pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,--he
  6049  will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last
  6050  you nine year.
  6051  
  6052  Ham.
  6053  Why he more than another?
  6054  
  6055  1 Clown.
  6056  Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that he will
  6057  keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
  6058  your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain
  6059  in the earth three-and-twenty years.
  6060  
  6061  Ham.
  6062  Whose was it?
  6063  
  6064  1 Clown.
  6065  A whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
  6066  
  6067  Ham.
  6068  Nay, I know not.
  6069  
  6070  1 Clown.
  6071  A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
  6072  Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
  6073  skull, the king's jester.
  6074  
  6075  Ham.
  6076  This?
  6077  
  6078  1 Clown.
  6079  E'en that.
  6080  
  6081  Ham.
  6082  Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick!--I knew him,
  6083  Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he
  6084  hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred
  6085  in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those
  6086  lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
  6087  now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that
  6088  were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
  6089  own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now, get you to my lady's
  6090  chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
  6091  favour she must come; make her laugh at that.--Pr'ythee, Horatio,
  6092  tell me one thing.
  6093  
  6094  Hor.
  6095  What's that, my lord?
  6096  
  6097  Ham.
  6098  Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?
  6099  
  6100  Hor.
  6101  E'en so.
  6102  
  6103  Ham.
  6104  And smelt so? Pah!
  6105  
  6106  [Throws down the skull.]
  6107  
  6108  Hor.
  6109  E'en so, my lord.
  6110  
  6111  Ham.
  6112  To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
  6113  imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
  6114  stopping a bung-hole?
  6115  
  6116  Hor.
  6117  'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.
  6118  
  6119  Ham.
  6120  No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
  6121  enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died,
  6122  Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
  6123  earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he
  6124  was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?
  6125     Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
  6126     Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
  6127     O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  6128     Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
  6129  But soft! but soft! aside!--Here comes the king.
  6130  
  6131  [Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia,
  6132  Laertes, and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.]
  6133  
  6134  The queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?
  6135  And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
  6136  The corse they follow did with desperate hand
  6137  Fordo it own life: 'twas of some estate.
  6138  Couch we awhile and mark.
  6139  
  6140  [Retiring with Horatio.]
  6141  
  6142  Laer.
  6143  What ceremony else?
  6144  
  6145  Ham.
  6146  That is Laertes,
  6147  A very noble youth: mark.
  6148  
  6149  Laer.
  6150  What ceremony else?
  6151  
  6152  1 Priest.
  6153  Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
  6154  As we have warranties: her death was doubtful;
  6155  And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
  6156  She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
  6157  Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
  6158  Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,
  6159  Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
  6160  Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
  6161  Of bell and burial.
  6162  
  6163  Laer.
  6164  Must there no more be done?
  6165  
  6166  1 Priest.
  6167  No more be done;
  6168  We should profane the service of the dead
  6169  To sing a requiem and such rest to her
  6170  As to peace-parted souls.
  6171  
  6172  Laer.
  6173  Lay her i' the earth;--
  6174  And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
  6175  May violets spring!--I tell thee, churlish priest,
  6176  A ministering angel shall my sister be
  6177  When thou liest howling.
  6178  
  6179  Ham.
  6180  What, the fair Ophelia?
  6181  
  6182  Queen.
  6183  Sweets to the sweet: farewell.
  6184  [Scattering flowers.]
  6185  I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
  6186  I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
  6187  And not have strew'd thy grave.
  6188  
  6189  Laer.
  6190  O, treble woe
  6191  Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
  6192  Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
  6193  Depriv'd thee of!--Hold off the earth awhile,
  6194  Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
  6195  [Leaps into the grave.]
  6196  Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
  6197  Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
  6198  To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
  6199  Of blue Olympus.
  6200  
  6201  Ham.
  6202  [Advancing.]
  6203  What is he whose grief
  6204  Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
  6205  Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
  6206  Like wonder-wounded hearers? this is I,
  6207  Hamlet the Dane.
  6208  [Leaps into the grave.]
  6209  
  6210  Laer.
  6211  The devil take thy soul!
  6212  [Grappling with him.]
  6213  
  6214  Ham.
  6215  Thou pray'st not well.
  6216  I pr'ythee, take thy fingers from my throat;
  6217  For, though I am not splenetive and rash,
  6218  Yet have I in me something dangerous,
  6219  Which let thy wiseness fear: away thy hand!
  6220  
  6221  King.
  6222  Pluck them asunder.
  6223  
  6224  Queen.
  6225  Hamlet! Hamlet!
  6226  
  6227  All.
  6228  Gentlemen!--
  6229  
  6230  Hor.
  6231  Good my lord, be quiet.
  6232  
  6233  [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.]
  6234  
  6235  Ham.
  6236  Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
  6237  Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  6238  
  6239  Queen.
  6240  O my son, what theme?
  6241  
  6242  Ham.
  6243  I lov'd Ophelia; forty thousand brothers
  6244  Could not, with all their quantity of love,
  6245  Make up my sum.--What wilt thou do for her?
  6246  
  6247  King.
  6248  O, he is mad, Laertes.
  6249  
  6250  Queen.
  6251  For love of God, forbear him!
  6252  
  6253  Ham.
  6254  'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
  6255  Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
  6256  Woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
  6257  I'll do't.--Dost thou come here to whine?
  6258  To outface me with leaping in her grave?
  6259  Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
  6260  And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
  6261  Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
  6262  Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
  6263  Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
  6264  I'll rant as well as thou.
  6265  
  6266  Queen.
  6267  This is mere madness:
  6268  And thus a while the fit will work on him;
  6269  Anon, as patient as the female dove,
  6270  When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
  6271  His silence will sit drooping.
  6272  
  6273  Ham.
  6274  Hear you, sir;
  6275  What is the reason that you use me thus?
  6276  I lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;
  6277  Let Hercules himself do what he may,
  6278  The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
  6279  
  6280  [Exit.]
  6281  
  6282  King.
  6283  I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.--
  6284  
  6285  [Exit Horatio.]
  6286  [To Laertes]
  6287  Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
  6288  We'll put the matter to the present push.--
  6289  Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.--
  6290  This grave shall have a living monument:
  6291  An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
  6292  Till then in patience our proceeding be.
  6293  
  6294  [Exeunt.]
  6295  
  6296  
  6297  
  6298  Scene II. A hall in the Castle.
  6299  
  6300  [Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]
  6301  
  6302  Ham.
  6303  So much for this, sir: now let me see the other;
  6304  You do remember all the circumstance?
  6305  
  6306  Hor.
  6307  Remember it, my lord!
  6308  
  6309  Ham.
  6310  Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
  6311  That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
  6312  Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,
  6313  And prais'd be rashness for it,--let us know,
  6314  Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,
  6315  When our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us
  6316  There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
  6317  Rough-hew them how we will.
  6318  
  6319  Hor.
  6320  That is most certain.
  6321  
  6322  Ham.
  6323  Up from my cabin,
  6324  My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
  6325  Grop'd I to find out them: had my desire;
  6326  Finger'd their packet; and, in fine, withdrew
  6327  To mine own room again: making so bold,
  6328  My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
  6329  Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
  6330  O royal knavery! an exact command,--
  6331  Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
  6332  Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
  6333  With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,--
  6334  That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
  6335  No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
  6336  My head should be struck off.
  6337  
  6338  Hor.
  6339  Is't possible?
  6340  
  6341  Ham.
  6342  Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
  6343  But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  6344  
  6345  Hor.
  6346  I beseech you.
  6347  
  6348  Ham.
  6349  Being thus benetted round with villanies,--
  6350  Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
  6351  They had begun the play,--I sat me down;
  6352  Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair:
  6353  I once did hold it, as our statists do,
  6354  A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
  6355  How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
  6356  It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
  6357  The effect of what I wrote?
  6358  
  6359  Hor.
  6360  Ay, good my lord.
  6361  
  6362  Ham.
  6363  An earnest conjuration from the king,--
  6364  As England was his faithful tributary;
  6365  As love between them like the palm might flourish;
  6366  As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
  6367  And stand a comma 'tween their amities;
  6368  And many such-like as's of great charge,--
  6369  That, on the view and know of these contents,
  6370  Without debatement further, more or less,
  6371  He should the bearers put to sudden death,
  6372  Not shriving-time allow'd.
  6373  
  6374  Hor.
  6375  How was this seal'd?
  6376  
  6377  Ham.
  6378  Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
  6379  I had my father's signet in my purse,
  6380  Which was the model of that Danish seal:
  6381  Folded the writ up in the form of the other;
  6382  Subscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,
  6383  The changeling never known. Now, the next day
  6384  Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
  6385  Thou know'st already.
  6386  
  6387  Hor.
  6388  So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  6389  
  6390  Ham.
  6391  Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
  6392  They are not near my conscience; their defeat
  6393  Does by their own insinuation grow:
  6394  'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
  6395  Between the pass and fell incensed points
  6396  Of mighty opposites.
  6397  
  6398  Hor.
  6399  Why, what a king is this!
  6400  
  6401  Ham.
  6402  Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon,--
  6403  He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
  6404  Popp'd in between the election and my hopes;
  6405  Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
  6406  And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience
  6407  To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd
  6408  To let this canker of our nature come
  6409  In further evil?
  6410  
  6411  Hor.
  6412  It must be shortly known to him from England
  6413  What is the issue of the business there.
  6414  
  6415  Ham.
  6416  It will be short: the interim is mine;
  6417  And a man's life is no more than to say One.
  6418  But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
  6419  That to Laertes I forgot myself;
  6420  For by the image of my cause I see
  6421  The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:
  6422  But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
  6423  Into a towering passion.
  6424  
  6425  Hor.
  6426  Peace; who comes here?
  6427  
  6428  [Enter Osric.]
  6429  
  6430  Osr.
  6431  Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  6432  
  6433  Ham.
  6434  I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
  6435  
  6436  Hor.
  6437  No, my good lord.
  6438  
  6439  Ham.
  6440  Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He
  6441  hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and
  6442  his crib shall stand at the king's mess; 'tis a chough; but, as I
  6443  say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
  6444  
  6445  Osr.
  6446  Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
  6447  impart a thing to you from his majesty.
  6448  
  6449  Ham.
  6450  I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your
  6451  bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
  6452  
  6453  Osr.
  6454  I thank your lordship, t'is very hot.
  6455  
  6456  Ham.
  6457  No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  6458  
  6459  Osr.
  6460  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  6461  
  6462  Ham.
  6463  Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
  6464  
  6465  Osr.
  6466  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as 'twere--I cannot
  6467  tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that
  6468  he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
  6469  matter,--
  6470  
  6471  Ham.
  6472  I beseech you, remember,--
  6473  [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  6474  
  6475  Osr.
  6476  Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
  6477  is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
  6478  gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft
  6479  society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he
  6480  is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
  6481  continent of what part a gentleman would see.
  6482  
  6483  Ham.
  6484  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;--though, I
  6485  know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of
  6486  memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
  6487  But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
  6488  article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
  6489  true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
  6490  would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  6491  
  6492  Osr.
  6493  Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  6494  
  6495  Ham.
  6496  The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
  6497  rawer breath?
  6498  
  6499  Osr.
  6500  Sir?
  6501  
  6502  Hor.
  6503  Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,
  6504  sir, really.
  6505  
  6506  Ham.
  6507  What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  6508  
  6509  Osr.
  6510  Of Laertes?
  6511  
  6512  Hor.
  6513  His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
  6514  
  6515  Ham.
  6516  Of him, sir.
  6517  
  6518  Osr.
  6519  I know, you are not ignorant,--
  6520  
  6521  Ham.
  6522  I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
  6523  much approve me.--Well, sir.
  6524  
  6525  Osr.
  6526  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,--
  6527  
  6528  Ham.
  6529  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
  6530  excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  6531  
  6532  Osr.
  6533  I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
  6534  him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  6535  
  6536  Ham.
  6537  What's his weapon?
  6538  
  6539  Osr.
  6540  Rapier and dagger.
  6541  
  6542  Ham.
  6543  That's two of his weapons:--but well.
  6544  
  6545  Osr.
  6546  The king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:
  6547  against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French
  6548  rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
  6549  so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
  6550  very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
  6551  very liberal conceit.
  6552  
  6553  Ham.
  6554  What call you the carriages?
  6555  
  6556  Hor.
  6557  I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
  6558  
  6559  Osr.
  6560  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  6561  
  6562  Ham.
  6563  The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could
  6564  carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.
  6565  But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
  6566  assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that's the French
  6567  bet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?
  6568  
  6569  Osr.
  6570  The king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
  6571  your and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath
  6572  laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial
  6573  if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  6574  
  6575  Ham.
  6576  How if I answer no?
  6577  
  6578  Osr.
  6579  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  6580  
  6581  Ham.
  6582  Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,
  6583  it is the breathing time of day with me: let the foils be
  6584  brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,
  6585  I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
  6586  shame and the odd hits.
  6587  
  6588  Osr.
  6589  Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
  6590  
  6591  Ham.
  6592  To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
  6593  
  6594  Osr.
  6595  I commend my duty to your lordship.
  6596  
  6597  Ham.
  6598  Yours, yours.
  6599  
  6600  [Exit Osric.]
  6601  
  6602  He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else
  6603  for's turn.
  6604  
  6605  Hor.
  6606  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  6607  
  6608  Ham.
  6609  He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,--and
  6610  many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,--
  6611  only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;
  6612  a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
  6613  through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
  6614  them to their trial, the bubbles are out,
  6615  
  6616  [Enter a Lord.]
  6617  
  6618  Lord.
  6619  My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
  6620  who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends
  6621  to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
  6622  will take longer time.
  6623  
  6624  Ham.
  6625  I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:
  6626  if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
  6627  I be so able as now.
  6628  
  6629  Lord.
  6630  The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  6631  
  6632  Ham.
  6633  In happy time.
  6634  
  6635  Lord.
  6636  The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
  6637  Laertes before you fall to play.
  6638  
  6639  Ham.
  6640  She well instructs me.
  6641  
  6642  [Exit Lord.]
  6643  
  6644  Hor.
  6645  You will lose this wager, my lord.
  6646  
  6647  Ham.
  6648  I do not think so; since he went into France I have been in
  6649  continual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
  6650  think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.
  6651  
  6652  Hor.
  6653  Nay, good my lord,--
  6654  
  6655  Ham.
  6656  It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as
  6657  would perhaps trouble a woman.
  6658  
  6659  Hor.
  6660  If your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will forestall their
  6661  repair hither, and say you are not fit.
  6662  
  6663  Ham.
  6664  Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in
  6665  the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be
  6666  not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
  6667  the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves,
  6668  what is't to leave betimes?
  6669  
  6670  [Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with
  6671  foils &c.]
  6672  
  6673  King.
  6674  Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
  6675  
  6676  [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  6677  
  6678  Ham.
  6679  Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong:
  6680  But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
  6681  This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,
  6682  How I am punish'd with sore distraction.
  6683  What I have done
  6684  That might your nature, honour, and exception
  6685  Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
  6686  Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
  6687  If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
  6688  And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
  6689  Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
  6690  Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
  6691  Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
  6692  His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
  6693  Sir, in this audience,
  6694  Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
  6695  Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
  6696  That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
  6697  And hurt my brother.
  6698  
  6699  Laer.
  6700  I am satisfied in nature,
  6701  Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
  6702  To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
  6703  I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement
  6704  Till by some elder masters of known honour
  6705  I have a voice and precedent of peace
  6706  To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
  6707  I do receive your offer'd love like love,
  6708  And will not wrong it.
  6709  
  6710  Ham.
  6711  I embrace it freely;
  6712  And will this brother's wager frankly play.--
  6713  Give us the foils; come on.
  6714  
  6715  Laer.
  6716  Come, one for me.
  6717  
  6718  Ham.
  6719  I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
  6720  Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,
  6721  Stick fiery off indeed.
  6722  
  6723  Laer.
  6724  You mock me, sir.
  6725  
  6726  Ham.
  6727  No, by this hand.
  6728  
  6729  King.
  6730  Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
  6731  You know the wager?
  6732  
  6733  Ham.
  6734  Very well, my lord;
  6735  Your grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.
  6736  
  6737  King.
  6738  I do not fear it; I have seen you both;
  6739  But since he's better'd, we have therefore odds.
  6740  
  6741  Laer.
  6742  This is too heavy, let me see another.
  6743  
  6744  Ham.
  6745  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  6746  
  6747  [They prepare to play.]
  6748  
  6749  Osr.
  6750  Ay, my good lord.
  6751  
  6752  King.
  6753  Set me the stoups of wine upon that table,--
  6754  If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
  6755  Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
  6756  Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
  6757  The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
  6758  And in the cup an union shall he throw,
  6759  Richer than that which four successive kings
  6760  In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
  6761  And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
  6762  The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
  6763  The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
  6764  'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.'--Come, begin:--
  6765  And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
  6766  
  6767  Ham.
  6768  Come on, sir.
  6769  
  6770  Laer.
  6771  Come, my lord.
  6772  
  6773  [They play.]
  6774  
  6775  Ham.
  6776  One.
  6777  
  6778  Laer.
  6779  No.
  6780  
  6781  Ham.
  6782  Judgment!
  6783  
  6784  Osr.
  6785  A hit, a very palpable hit.
  6786  
  6787  Laer.
  6788  Well;--again.
  6789  
  6790  King.
  6791  Stay, give me drink.--Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
  6792  Here's to thy health.--
  6793  
  6794  [Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.]
  6795  
  6796  Give him the cup.
  6797  
  6798  Ham.
  6799  I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.--
  6800  Come.--Another hit; what say you?
  6801  
  6802  [They play.]
  6803  
  6804  Laer.
  6805  A touch, a touch, I do confess.
  6806  
  6807  King.
  6808  Our son shall win.
  6809  
  6810  Queen.
  6811  He's fat, and scant of breath.--
  6812  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:
  6813  The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  6814  
  6815  Ham.
  6816  Good madam!
  6817  
  6818  King.
  6819  Gertrude, do not drink.
  6820  
  6821  Queen.
  6822  I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
  6823  
  6824  King.
  6825  [Aside.] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  6826  
  6827  Ham.
  6828  I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  6829  
  6830  Queen.
  6831  Come, let me wipe thy face.
  6832  
  6833  Laer.
  6834  My lord, I'll hit him now.
  6835  
  6836  King.
  6837  I do not think't.
  6838  
  6839  Laer.
  6840  [Aside.] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
  6841  
  6842  Ham.
  6843  Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
  6844  I pray you pass with your best violence:
  6845  I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  6846  
  6847  Laer.
  6848  Say you so? come on.
  6849  
  6850  [They play.]
  6851  
  6852  Osr.
  6853  Nothing, neither way.
  6854  
  6855  Laer.
  6856  Have at you now!
  6857  
  6858  [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they
  6859  change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]
  6860  
  6861  King.
  6862  Part them; they are incens'd.
  6863  
  6864  Ham.
  6865  Nay, come again!
  6866  
  6867  [The Queen falls.]
  6868  
  6869  Osr.
  6870  Look to the queen there, ho!
  6871  
  6872  Hor.
  6873  They bleed on both sides.--How is it, my lord?
  6874  
  6875  Osr.
  6876  How is't, Laertes?
  6877  
  6878  Laer.
  6879  Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;
  6880  I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  6881  
  6882  Ham.
  6883  How does the Queen?
  6884  
  6885  King.
  6886  She swoons to see them bleed.
  6887  
  6888  Queen.
  6889  No, no! the drink, the drink!--O my dear Hamlet!--
  6890  The drink, the drink!--I am poison'd.
  6891  
  6892  [Dies.]
  6893  
  6894  Ham.
  6895  O villany!--Ho! let the door be lock'd:
  6896  Treachery! seek it out.
  6897  
  6898  [Laertes falls.]
  6899  
  6900  Laer.
  6901  It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
  6902  No medicine in the world can do thee good;
  6903  In thee there is not half an hour of life;
  6904  The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
  6905  Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice
  6906  Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
  6907  Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
  6908  I can no more:--the king, the king's to blame.
  6909  
  6910  Ham.
  6911  The point envenom'd too!--
  6912  Then, venom, to thy work.
  6913  
  6914  [Stabs the King.]
  6915  
  6916  Osric and Lords.
  6917  Treason! treason!
  6918  
  6919  King.
  6920  O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  6921  
  6922  Ham.
  6923  Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
  6924  Drink off this potion.--Is thy union here?
  6925  Follow my mother.
  6926  
  6927  [King dies.]
  6928  
  6929  Laer.
  6930  He is justly serv'd;
  6931  It is a poison temper'd by himself.--
  6932  Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
  6933  Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
  6934  Nor thine on me!
  6935  
  6936  [Dies.]
  6937  
  6938  Ham.
  6939  Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.--
  6940  I am dead, Horatio.--Wretched queen, adieu!--
  6941  You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
  6942  That are but mutes or audience to this act,
  6943  Had I but time,--as this fell sergeant, death,
  6944  Is strict in his arrest,--O, I could tell you,--
  6945  But let it be.--Horatio, I am dead;
  6946  Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
  6947  To the unsatisfied.
  6948  
  6949  Hor.
  6950  Never believe it:
  6951  I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.--
  6952  Here's yet some liquor left.
  6953  
  6954  Ham.
  6955  As thou'rt a man,
  6956  Give me the cup; let go; by heaven, I'll have't.--
  6957  O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
  6958  Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
  6959  If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
  6960  Absent thee from felicity awhile,
  6961  And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
  6962  To tell my story.--
  6963  
  6964  [March afar off, and shot within.]
  6965  
  6966  What warlike noise is this?
  6967  
  6968  Osr.
  6969  Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
  6970  To the ambassadors of England gives
  6971  This warlike volley.
  6972  
  6973  Ham.
  6974  O, I die, Horatio;
  6975  The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
  6976  I cannot live to hear the news from England;
  6977  But I do prophesy the election lights
  6978  On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
  6979  So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
  6980  Which have solicited.--the rest is silence.
  6981  
  6982  [Dies.]
  6983  
  6984  Hor.
  6985  Now cracks a noble heart.--Good night, sweet prince,
  6986  And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
  6987  Why does the drum come hither?
  6988  
  6989  [March within.]
  6990  
  6991  [Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors, and others.]
  6992  
  6993  Fort.
  6994  Where is this sight?
  6995  
  6996  Hor.
  6997  What is it you will see?
  6998  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  6999  
  7000  Fort.
  7001  This quarry cries on havoc.--O proud death,
  7002  What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
  7003  That thou so many princes at a shot
  7004  So bloodily hast struck?
  7005  
  7006  1 Ambassador.
  7007  The sight is dismal;
  7008  And our affairs from England come too late:
  7009  The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
  7010  To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
  7011  That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
  7012  Where should we have our thanks?
  7013  
  7014  Hor.
  7015  Not from his mouth,
  7016  Had it the ability of life to thank you:
  7017  He never gave commandment for their death.
  7018  But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
  7019  You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
  7020  Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
  7021  High on a stage be placed to the view;
  7022  And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
  7023  How these things came about: so shall you hear
  7024  Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
  7025  Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
  7026  Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
  7027  And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
  7028  Fall'n on the inventors' heads: all this can I
  7029  Truly deliver.
  7030  
  7031  Fort.
  7032  Let us haste to hear it,
  7033  And call the noblest to the audience.
  7034  For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
  7035  I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
  7036  Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  7037  
  7038  Hor.
  7039  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  7040  And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
  7041  But let this same be presently perform'd,
  7042  Even while men's minds are wild: lest more mischance
  7043  On plots and errors happen.
  7044  
  7045  Fort.
  7046  Let four captains
  7047  Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
  7048  For he was likely, had he been put on,
  7049  To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage,
  7050  The soldiers' music and the rites of war
  7051  Speak loudly for him.--
  7052  Take up the bodies.--Such a sight as this
  7053  Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
  7054  Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
  7055  
  7056  [A dead march.]
  7057  
  7058  [Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after the which a peal of
  7059  ordnance is shot off.]

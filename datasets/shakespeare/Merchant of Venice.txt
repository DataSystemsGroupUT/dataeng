    41  Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
    42  all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
    43  copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
    44  of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
    45  
    46  
    47  We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
    48  of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
    49  
    50  Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
    51  midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
    52  The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
    53  Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
    54  preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
    55  and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
    56  up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
    57  in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
    58  a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
    59  look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
    60  new copy has at least one byte more or less.

    63  Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
    64  
    65  We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
    66  time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
    67  to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
    68  searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
    69  projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
    70  per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
    71  million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
    72  files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
    73  If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
    74  total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
    75  
    76  The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
    77  Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
    78  This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
    79  which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
    80  
    81  At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
    82  of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
    83  manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
    84  from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
    85  assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
    86  more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
    87  don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

   147  Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
   148  They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
   149  your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
   150  someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
   151  fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
   152  disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
   153  you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
   154  
   155  *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
   156  By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
   157  etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
   158  this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
   159  a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
   160  sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
   161  you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
   162  medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
   163  
   164  ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
   165  This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
   166  tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
   167  Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
   168  Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
   169  things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
   170  on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
   171  distribute it in the United States without permission and
   172  without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
   173  below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
   174  under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
   175  
   176  To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
   177  efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
   178  works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
   179  medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
   180  things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
   181  corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
   182  intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
   183  disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
   184  codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
   185  
   186  LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
   187  But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
   188  [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
   189  etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
   190  liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
   191  legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
   192  UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
   193  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   194  OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
   195  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   196  
   197  If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
   198  receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
   199  you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
   200  time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
   201  on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
   202  such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
   203  copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
   204  choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
   205  receive it electronically.
   206  
   207  THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
   208  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
   209  TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
   210  LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   211  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   212  
   213  Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
   214  the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
   215  above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
   216  may have other legal rights.
   217

   219  You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
   220  officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost

   222  indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:

   254  
   255       [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
   256            no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

   291  Executive Director's Notes:
   292  
   293  In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
   294  the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
   295  been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
   296  are presented herein:
   297  
   298    Barnardo. Who's there?
   299    Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
   300  your selfe
   301  
   302     Bar. Long liue the King
   303  
   304  ***
   305  
   306  As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
   307  or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
   308  original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
   309  to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
   310  that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
   311  above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
   312  Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .
   313  
   314  The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
   315  time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
   316  place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
   317  as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
   318  more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
   319  
   320  You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
   321  have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
   322  extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
   323  very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
   324  assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
   325  in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
   326  purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
   327  . . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
   328  that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
   329  variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
   330  for signing his name with several different spellings.
   331  
   332  So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
   333  made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
   334  that are "not" errors. . . .
   335  
   336  So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
   337  here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The first 
   338  Part of Henry the Sixt.

   347  
   348  Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
   349  a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
   350  come in ASCII to the printed text.
   351  
   352  The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
   353  conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
   354  punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
   355  printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
   356  together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
   357  Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
   358  spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
   359  abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
   360  brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
   361  you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
   362  purer Shakespeare.
   363  
   364  Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
   365  differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
   366  be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
   367  this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
   368  habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
   369  then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
   370  continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
   371  incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
   372  The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
   373  First Folio editions' best pages.
   374  
   375  If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
   376  errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
   377  free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
   378  etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
   379  and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.

   388  
   389    Anthonio. In sooth I know not why I am so sad,
   390  It wearies me: you say it wearies you;
   391  But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
   392  What stuffe 'tis made of, whereof it is borne,
   393  I am to learne: and such a Want-wit sadnesse makes of
   394  mee,
   395  That I haue much ado to know my selfe
   396  
   397     Sal. Your minde is tossing on the Ocean,
   398  There where your Argosies with portly saile
   399  Like Signiors and rich Burgers on the flood,
   400  Or as it were the Pageants of the sea,
   401  Do ouer-peere the pettie Traffiquers
   402  That curtsie to them, do them reuerence
   403  As they flye by them with their wouen wings
   404  
   405     Salar. Beleeue me sir, had I such venture forth,
   406  The better part of my affections, would
   407  Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
   408  Plucking the grasse to know where sits the winde,
   409  Peering in Maps for ports, and peers, and rodes:
   410  And euery obiect that might make me feare
   411  Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
   412  Would make me sad
   413  
   414     Sal. My winde cooling my broth,
   415  Would blow me to an Ague, when I thought
   416  What harme a winde too great might doe at sea.
   417  I should not see the sandie houre-glasse runne,
   418  But I should thinke of shallows, and of flats,
   419  And see my wealthy Andrew docks in sand,
   420  Vailing her high top lower then her ribs
   421  To kisse her buriall; should I goe to Church
   422  And see the holy edifice of stone,
   423  And not bethinke me straight of dangerous rocks,
   424  Which touching but my gentle Vessels side
   425  Would scatter all her spices on the streame,
   426  Enrobe the roring waters with my silkes,
   427  And in a word, but euen now worth this,
   428  And now worth nothing. Shall I haue the thought
   429  To thinke on this, and shall I lacke the thought
   430  That such a thing bechaunc'd would make me sad?
   431  But tell me, I know Anthonio
   432  Is sad to thinke vpon his merchandize
   433  
   434     Anth. Beleeue me no, I thanke my fortune for it,
   435  My ventures are not in one bottome trusted,
   436  Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
   437  Vpon the fortune of this present yeere:
   438  Therefore my merchandize makes me not sad
   439  
   440     Sola. Why then you are in loue
   441  
   442     Anth. Fie, fie
   443  
   444     Sola. Not in loue neither: then let vs say you are sad
   445  Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easie
   446  For you to laugh and leape, and say you are merry
   447  Because you are not sad. Now by two-headed Ianus,
   448  Nature hath fram'd strange fellowes in her time:
   449  Some that will euermore peepe through their eyes,
   450  And laugh like Parrats at a bag-piper.
   451  And other of such vineger aspect,
   452  That they'll not shew their teeth in way of smile,
   453  Though Nestor sweare the iest be laughable.
   454  Enter Bassanio, Lorenso, and Gratiano.
   455  
   456    Sola. Heere comes Bassanio,
   457  Your most noble Kinsman,
   458  Gratiano, and Lorenso. Faryewell,
   459  We leaue you now with better company
   460  
   461     Sala. I would haue staid till I had made you merry,
   462  If worthier friends had not preuented me
   463  
   464     Ant. Your worth is very deere in my regard.
   465  I take it your owne busines calls on you,
   466  And you embrace th' occasion to depart
   467  
   468     Sal. Good morrow my good Lords
   469  
   470     Bass. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
   471  You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
   472    Sal. Wee'll make our leysures to attend on yours.
   473  
   474  Exeunt. Salarino, and Solanio.
   475  
   476    Lor. My Lord Bassanio, since you haue found Anthonio
   477  We two will leaue you, but at dinner time
   478  I pray you haue in minde where we must meete
   479  
   480     Bass. I will not faile you
   481  
   482     Grat. You looke not well signior Anthonio,
   483  You haue too much respect vpon the world:
   484  They loose it that doe buy it with much care,
   485  Beleeue me you are maruellously chang'd
   486  
   487     Ant. I hold the world but as the world Gratiano,
   488  A stage, where euery man must play a part,
   489  And mine a sad one
   490  
   491     Grati. Let me play the foole,
   492  With mirth and laughter let old wrinckles come,
   493  And let my Liuer rather heate with wine,
   494  Then my heart coole with mortifying grones.
   495  Why should a man whose bloud is warme within,
   496  Sit like his Grandsire, cut in Alablaster?
   497  Sleepe when he wakes? and creep into the Iaundies
   498  By being peeuish? I tell thee what Anthonio,
   499  I loue thee, and it is my loue that speakes:
   500  There are a sort of men, whose visages
   501  Do creame and mantle like a standing pond,
   502  And do a wilfull stilnesse entertaine,
   503  With purpose to be drest in an opinion
   504  Of wisedome, grauity, profound conceit,
   505  As who should say, I am sir an Oracle,
   506  And when I ope my lips, let no dogge barke.
   507  O my Anthonio, I do know of these
   508  That therefore onely are reputed wise,
   509  For saying nothing; when I am verie sure
   510  If they should speake, would almost dam those eares
   511  Which hearing them would call their brothers fooles:
   512  Ile tell thee more of this another time.
   513  But fish not with this melancholly baite
   514  For this foole Gudgin, this opinion:
   515  Come good Lorenzo, faryewell a while,
   516  Ile end my exhortation after dinner
   517  
   518     Lor. Well, we will leaue you then till dinner time.
   519  I must be one of these same dumbe wise men.
   520  For Gratiano neuer let's me speake
   521  
   522     Gra. Well, keepe me company but two yeares mo,
   523  Thou shalt not know the sound of thine owne tongue
   524  
   525     Ant. Far you well, Ile grow a talker for this geare
   526  
   527     Gra. Thankes ifaith, for silence is onely commendable
   528  In a neats tongue dri'd, and a maid not vendible.
   529  Enter.
   530  
   531    Ant. It is that any thing now
   532  
   533     Bas. Gratiano speakes an infinite deale of nothing,
   534  more then any man in all Venice, his reasons are two
   535  graines of wheate hid in two bushels of chaffe: you shall
   536  seeke all day ere you finde them, & when you haue them
   537  they are not worth the search
   538  
   539     An. Well: tel me now, what Lady is the same
   540  To whom you swore a secret Pilgrimage
   541  That you to day promis'd to tel me of?
   542    Bas. Tis not vnknowne to you Anthonio
   543  How much I haue disabled mine estate,
   544  By something shewing a more swelling port
   545  Then my faint meanes would grant continuance:
   546  Nor do I now make mone to be abridg'd
   547  From such a noble rate, but my cheefe care
   548  Is to come fairely off from the great debts
   549  Wherein my time something too prodigall
   550  Hath left me gag'd: to you Anthonio
   551  I owe the most in money, and in loue,
   552  And from your loue I haue a warrantie
   553  To vnburthen all my plots and purposes,
   554  How to get cleere of all the debts I owe
   555  
   556     An. I pray you good Bassanio let me know it,
   557  And if it stand as you your selfe still do,
   558  Within the eye of honour, be assur'd
   559  My purse, my person, my extreamest meanes
   560  Lye all vnlock'd to your occasions
   561  
   562     Bass. In my schoole dayes, when I had lost one shaft
   563  I shot his fellow of the selfesame flight
   564  The selfesame way, with more aduised watch
   565  To finde the other forth, and by aduenturing both,
   566  I oft found both. I vrge this child-hoode proofe,
   567  Because what followes is pure innocence.
   568  I owe you much, and like a wilfull youth,
   569  That which I owe is lost: but if you please
   570  To shoote another arrow that selfe way
   571  Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
   572  As I will watch the ayme: Or to finde both,
   573  Or bring your latter hazard backe againe,
   574  And thankfully rest debter for the first
   575  
   576     An. You know me well, and herein spend but time
   577  To winde about my loue with circumstance,
   578  And out of doubt you doe more wrong
   579  In making question of my vttermost
   580  Then if you had made waste of all I haue:
   581  Then doe but say to me what I should doe
   582  That in your knowledge may by me be done,
   583  And I am prest vnto it: therefore speake
   584  
   585     Bass. In Belmont is a Lady richly left,
   586  And she is faire, and fairer then that word,
   587  Of wondrous vertues, sometimes from her eyes
   588  I did receiue faire speechlesse messages:
   589  Her name is Portia, nothing vndervallewd
   590  To Cato's daughter, Brutus Portia,
   591  Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
   592  For the four windes blow in from euery coast
   593  Renowned sutors, and her sunny locks
   594  Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
   595  Which makes her seat of Belmont Cholchos strond,
   596  And many Iasons come in quest of her.
   597  O my Anthonio, had I but the meanes
   598  To hold a riuall place with one of them,
   599  I haue a minde presages me such thrift,
   600  That I should questionlesse be fortunate
   601  
   602     Anth. Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea,
   603  Neither haue I money, nor commodity
   604  To raise a present summe, therefore goe forth
   605  Try what my credit can in Venice doe,
   606  That shall be rackt euen to the vttermost,
   607  To furnish thee to Belmont to faire Portia.
   608  Goe presently enquire, and so will I
   609  Where money is, and I no question make
   610  To haue it of my trust, or for my sake.
   611  
   612  Exeunt.
   613  
   614  Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.
   615  
   616    Portia. By my troth Nerrissa, my little body is a wearie
   617  of this great world
   618  
   619     Ner. You would be sweet Madam, if your miseries
   620  were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are:
   621  and yet for ought I see, they are as sicke that surfet with
   622  too much, as they that starue with nothing; it is no smal
   623  happinesse therefore to bee seated in the meane, superfluitie
   624  comes sooner by white haires, but competencie
   625  liues longer
   626  
   627     Portia. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd
   628  
   629     Ner. They would be better if well followed
   630  
   631     Portia. If to doe were as easie as to know what were
   632  good to doe, Chappels had beene Churches, and poore
   633  mens cottages Princes Pallaces: it is a good Diuine that
   634  followes his owne instructions; I can easier teach twentie
   635  what were good to be done, then be one of the twentie
   636  to follow mine owne teaching: the braine may deuise
   637  lawes for the blood, but a hot temper leapes ore a
   638  colde decree, such a hare is madnesse the youth, to skip
   639  ore the meshes of good counsaile the cripple; but this
   640  reason is not in fashion to choose me a husband: O mee,
   641  the word choose, I may neither choose whom I would,
   642  nor refuse whom I dislike, so is the wil of a liuing daughter
   643  curb'd by the will of a dead father: it is not hard Nerrissa,
   644  that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none
   645  
   646     Ner. Your father was euer vertuous, and holy men
   647  at their death haue good inspirations, therefore the lotterie
   648  that hee hath deuised in these three chests of gold,
   649  siluer, and leade, whereof who chooses his meaning,
   650  chooses you, wil no doubt neuer be chosen by any rightly,
   651  but one who you shall rightly loue: but what warmth
   652  is there in your affection towards any of these Princely
   653  suters that are already come?
   654    Por. I pray thee ouer-name them, and as thou namest
   655  them, I will describe them, and according to my description
   656  leuell at my affection
   657  
   658     Ner. First there is the Neopolitane Prince
   659  
   660     Por. I that's a colt indeede, for he doth nothing but
   661  talke of his horse, and hee makes it a great appropriation
   662  to his owne good parts that he can shoo him himselfe:
   663  I am much afraid my Ladie his mother plaid false
   664  with a Smyth
   665  
   666     Ner. Than is there the Countie Palentine
   667  
   668     Por. He doth nothing but frowne (as who should
   669  say, and you will not haue me, choose: he heares merrie
   670  tales and smiles not, I feare hee will proue the weeping
   671  Phylosopher when he growes old, being so full of vnmannerly
   672  sadnesse in his youth.) I had rather to be married
   673  to a deaths head with a bone in his mouth, then to either
   674  of these: God defend me from these two
   675  
   676     Ner. How say you by the French Lord, Mounsier
   677  Le Boune?
   678    Por. God made him, and therefore let him passe for a
   679  man, in truth I know it is a sinne to be a mocker, but he,
   680  why he hath a horse better then the Neopolitans, a better
   681  bad habite of frowning then the Count Palentine, he
   682  is euery man in no man, if a Trassell sing, he fals straight
   683  a capring, he will fence with his owne shadow. If I should
   684  marry him, I should marry twentie husbands: if hee
   685  would despise me, I would forgiue him, for if he loue me
   686  to madnesse, I should neuer requite him
   687  
   688     Ner. What say you then to Fauconbridge, the yong
   689  Baron of England?
   690    Por. You know I say nothing to him, for hee vnderstands
   691  not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latine, French,
   692  nor Italian, and you will come into the Court & sweare
   693  that I haue a poore pennie-worth in the English: hee is a
   694  proper mans picture, but alas who can conuerse with a
   695  dumbe show? how odly he is suited, I thinke he bought
   696  his doublet in Italie, his round hose in France, his bonnet
   697  in Germanie, and his behauiour euery where
   698  
   699     Ner. What thinke you of the other Lord his neighbour?
   700    Por. That he hath a neighbourly charitie in him, for
   701  he borrowed a boxe of the eare of the Englishman, and
   702  swore he would pay him againe when hee was able: I
   703  thinke the Frenchman became his suretie, and seald vnder
   704  for another
   705  
   706     Ner. How like you the yong Germaine, the Duke of
   707  Saxonies Nephew?
   708    Por. Very vildely in the morning when hee is sober,
   709  and most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke:
   710  when he is best, he is a little worse then a man, and when
   711  he is worst, he is little better then a beast: and the worst
   712  fall that euer fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without
   713  him
   714  
   715     Ner. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
   716  Casket, you should refuse to performe your Fathers will,
   717  if you should refuse to accept him
   718  
   719     Por. Therefore for feare of the worst, I pray thee set
   720  a deepe glasse of Reinish-wine on the contrary Casket,
   721  for if the diuell be within, and that temptation without,
   722  I know he will choose it. I will doe any thing Nerrissa
   723  ere I will be married to a spunge
   724  
   725     Ner. You neede not feare Lady the hauing any of
   726  these Lords, they haue acquainted me with their determinations,
   727  which is indeede to returne to their home,
   728  and to trouble you with no more suite, vnlesse you may
   729  be won by some other sort then your Fathers imposition,
   730  depending on the Caskets
   731  
   732     Por. If I liue to be as olde as Sibilla, I will dye as
   733  chaste as Diana: vnlesse I be obtained by the manner
   734  of my Fathers will: I am glad this parcell of wooers
   735  are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but
   736  I doate on his verie absence: and I wish them a faire departure
   737  
   738     Ner. Doe you not remember Ladie in your Fathers
   739  time, a Venecian, a Scholler and a Souldior that
   740  came hither in companie of the Marquesse of Mountferrat?
   741    Por. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I thinke, so was hee
   742  call'd
   743  
   744     Ner. True Madam, hee of all the men that euer my
   745  foolish eyes look'd vpon, was the best deseruing a faire
   746  Lady
   747  
   748     Por. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy
   749  of thy praise.
   750  Enter a Seruingman.
   751  
   752    Ser. The four Strangers seeke you Madam to take
   753  their leaue: and there is a fore-runner come from a fift,
   754  the Prince of Moroco, who brings word the Prince his
   755  Maister will be here to night
   756  
   757     Por. If I could bid the fift welcome with so good
   758  heart as I can bid the other foure farewell, I should be
   759  glad of his approach: if he haue the condition of a Saint,
   760  and the complexion of a diuell, I had rather hee should
   761  shriue me then wiue me. Come Nerrissa, sirra go before;
   762  whiles wee shut the gate vpon one wooer, another
   763  knocks at the doore.
   764  
   765  Exeunt.
   766  
   767  Enter Bassanio with Shylocke the Iew.
   768  
   769    Shy. Three thousand ducates, well
   770  
   771     Bass. I sir, for three months
   772  
   773     Shy. For three months, well
   774  
   775     Bass. For the which, as I told you,
   776  Anthonio shall be bound
   777  
   778     Shy. Anthonio shall become bound, well
   779  
   780     Bass. May you sted me? Will you pleasure me?
   781  Shall I know your answere
   782  
   783     Shy. Three thousand ducats for three months,
   784  and Anthonio bound
   785  
   786     Bass. Your answere to that
   787  
   788     Shy. Anthonio is a good man
   789  
   790     Bass. Haue you heard any imputation to the contrary
   791  
   792     Shy. Ho no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
   793  good man, is to haue you vnderstand me that he is sufficient,
   794  yet his meanes are in supposition: he hath an Argosie
   795  bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies, I vnderstand
   796  moreouer vpon the Ryalta, he hath a third at Mexico,
   797  a fourth for England, and other ventures hee hath
   798  squandred abroad, but ships are but boords, Saylers but
   799  men, there be land rats, and water rats, water theeues,
   800  and land theeues, I meane Pyrats, and then there is the
   801  perrill of waters, windes, and rocks: the man is not withstanding
   802  sufficient, three thousand ducats, I thinke I may
   803  take his bond
   804  
   805     Bas. Be assured you may
   806  
   807     Iew. I will be assured I may: and that I may be assured,
   808  I will bethinke mee, may I speake with Anthonio?
   809    Bass. If it please you to dine with vs
   810  
   811     Iew. Yes, to smell porke, to eate of the habitation
   812  which your Prophet the Nazarite coniured the diuell
   813  into: I will buy with you, sell with you, talke with
   814  you, walke with you, and so following: but I will
   815  not eate with you, drinke with you, nor pray with you.
   816  What newes on the Ryalta, who is he comes here?
   817  Enter Anthonio.
   818  
   819    Bass. This is signior Anthonio
   820  
   821     Iew. How like a fawning publican he lookes.
   822  I hate him for he is a Christian:
   823  But more, for that in low simplicitie
   824  He lends out money gratis, and brings downe
   825  The rate of vsance here with vs in Venice.
   826  If I can catch him once vpon the hip,
   827  I will feede fat the ancient grudge I beare him.
   828  He hates our sacred Nation, and he railes
   829  Euen there where Merchants most doe congregate
   830  On me, my bargaines, and my well-worne thrift,
   831  Which he cals interrest: Cursed by my Trybe
   832  If I forgiue him
   833  
   834     Bass. Shylock, doe you heare
   835  
   836     Shy. I am debating of my present store,
   837  And by the neere gesse of my memorie
   838  I cannot instantly raise vp the grosse
   839  Of full three thousand ducats: what of that?
   840  Tuball a wealthy Hebrew of my Tribe
   841  Will furnish me: but soft, how many months
   842  Doe you desire? Rest you faire good signior,
   843  Your worship was the last man in our mouthes
   844  
   845     Ant. Shylocke, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
   846  By taking, nor by giuing of excesse,
   847  Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
   848  Ile breake a custome: is he yet possest
   849  How much he would?
   850    Shy. I, I, three thousand ducats
   851  
   852     Ant. And for three months
   853  
   854     Shy. I had forgot, three months, you told me so.
   855  Well then, your bond: and let me see, but heare you,
   856  Me thoughts you said, you neither lend nor borrow
   857  Vpon aduantage
   858  
   859     Ant. I doe neuer vse it
   860  
   861     Shy. When Iacob graz'd his vncle Labans sheepe,
   862  This Iacob from our holy Abram was
   863  (As his wise mother wrought in his behalfe)
   864  The third possesser; I, he was the third
   865  
   866     Ant. And what of him, did he take interrest?
   867    Shy. No, not take interest, not as you would say
   868  Directly interest, marke what Iacob did,
   869  When Laban and himselfe were compremyz'd
   870  That all the eanelings which were streakt and pied
   871  Should fall as Iacobs hier, the Ewes being rancke,
   872  In end of Autumne turned to the Rammes,
   873  And when the worke of generation was
   874  Betweene these woolly breeders in the act,
   875  The skilfull shepheard pil'd me certaine wands,
   876  And in the dooing of the deede of kinde,
   877  He stucke them vp before the fulsome Ewes,
   878  Who then conceauing, did in eaning time
   879  Fall party-colour'd lambs, and those were Iacobs.
   880  This was a way to thriue, and he was blest:
   881  And thrift is blessing if men steale it not
   882  
   883     Ant. This was a venture sir that Iacob seru'd for,
   884  A thing not in his power to bring to passe,
   885  But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heauen.
   886  Was this inserted to make interrest good?
   887  Or is your gold and siluer Ewes and Rams?
   888    Shy. I cannot tell, I make it breede as fast,
   889  But note me signior
   890  
   891     Ant. Marke you this Bassanio,
   892  The diuell can cite Scripture for his purpose,
   893  An euill soule producing holy witnesse,
   894  Is like a villaine with a smiling cheeke,
   895  A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
   896  O what a goodly outside falsehood hath
   897  
   898     Shy. Three thousand ducats, 'tis a good round sum.
   899  Three months from twelue, then let me see the rate
   900  
   901     Ant. Well Shylocke, shall we be beholding to you?
   902    Shy. Signior Anthonio, many a time and oft
   903  In the Ryalto you haue rated me
   904  About my monies and my vsances:
   905  Still haue I borne it with a patient shrug,
   906  (For suffrance is the badge of all our Tribe.)
   907  You call me misbeleeuer, cut-throate dog,
   908  And spet vpon my Iewish gaberdine,
   909  And all for vse of that which is mine owne.
   910  Well then, it now appeares you neede my helpe:
   911  Goe to then, you come to me, and you say,
   912  Shylocke, we would haue moneyes, you say so:
   913  You that did voide your rume vpon my beard,
   914  And foote me as you spurne a stranger curre
   915  Ouer your threshold, moneyes is your suite.
   916  What should I say to you? Should I not say,
   917  Hath a dog money? Is it possible
   918  A curre should lend three thousand ducats? or
   919  Shall I bend low, and in a bond-mans key
   920  With bated breath, and whispring humblenesse,
   921  Say this: Faire sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;
   922  You spurn'd me such a day; another time
   923  You cald me dog: and for these curtesies
   924  Ile lend you thus much moneyes
   925  
   926     Ant. I am as like to call thee so againe,
   927  To spet on thee againe, to spurne thee too.
   928  If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
   929  As to thy friends, for when did friendship take
   930  A breede of barraine mettall of his friend?
   931  But lend it rather to thine enemie,
   932  Who if he breake, thou maist with better face
   933  Exact the penalties
   934  
   935     Shy. Why looke you how you storme,
   936  I would be friends with you, and haue your loue,
   937  Forget the shames that you haue staind me with,
   938  Supplie your present wants, and take no doite
   939  Of vsance for my moneyes, and youle not heare me,
   940  This is kinde I offer
   941  
   942     Bass. This were kindnesse
   943  
   944     Shy. This kindnesse will I showe,
   945  Goe with me to a Notarie, seale me there
   946  Your single bond, and in a merrie sport
   947  If you repaie me not on such a day,
   948  In such a place, such sum or sums as are
   949  Exprest in the condition, let the forfeite
   950  Be nominated for an equall pound
   951  Of your faire flesh, to be cut off and taken
   952  In what part of your bodie it pleaseth me
   953  
   954     Ant. Content infaith, Ile seale to such a bond,
   955  And say there is much kindnesse in the Iew
   956  
   957     Bass. You shall not seale to such a bond for me,
   958  Ile rather dwell in my necessitie
   959  
   960     Ant. Why feare not man, I will not forfaite it,
   961  Within these two months, that's a month before
   962  This bond expires, I doe expect returne
   963  Of thrice three times the valew of this bond
   964  
   965     Shy. O father Abram, what these Christians are,
   966  Whose owne hard dealings teaches them suspect
   967  The thoughts of others: Praie you tell me this,
   968  If he should breake his daie, what should I gaine
   969  By the exaction of the forfeiture?
   970  A pound of mans flesh taken from a man,
   971  Is not so estimable, profitable neither
   972  As flesh of Muttons, Beefes, or Goates, I say
   973  To buy his fauour, I extend this friendship,
   974  If he will take it, so: if not adiew,
   975  And for my loue I praie you wrong me not
   976  
   977     Ant. Yes Shylocke, I will seale vnto this bond
   978  
   979     Shy. Then meete me forthwith at the Notaries,
   980  Giue him direction for this merrie bond,
   981  And I will goe and purse the ducats straite.
   982  See to my house left in the fearefull gard
   983  Of an vnthriftie knaue: and presentlie
   984  Ile be with you.
   985  Enter.
   986  
   987    Ant. Hie thee gentle Iew. This Hebrew will turne
   988  Christian, he growes kinde
   989  
   990     Bass. I like not faire tearmes, and a villaines minde
   991  
   992     Ant. Come on, in this there can be no dismaie,
   993  My Shippes come home a month before the daie.
   994  
   995  Exeunt.
   996  
   997  
   998  Actus Secundus.
   999  
  1000  Enter Morochus a tawnie Moore all in white, and three or foure
  1001  followers
  1002  accordingly, with Portia, Nerrissa, and their traine. Flo. Cornets.
  1003  
  1004    Mor. Mislike me not for my complexion,
  1005  The shadowed liuerie of the burnisht sunne,
  1006  To whom I am a neighbour, and neere bred.
  1007  Bring me the fairest creature North-ward borne,
  1008  Where Phoebus fire scarce thawes the ysicles,
  1009  And let vs make incision for your loue,
  1010  To proue whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
  1011  I tell thee Ladie this aspect of mine
  1012  Hath feard the valiant, (by my loue I sweare)
  1013  The best regarded Virgins of our Clyme
  1014  Haue lou'd it to: I would not change this hue,
  1015  Except to steale your thoughts my gentle Queene
  1016  
  1017     Por. In tearmes of choise I am not solie led
  1018  By nice direction of a maidens eies:
  1019  Besides, the lottrie of my destenie
  1020  Bars me the right of voluntarie choosing:
  1021  But if my Father had not scanted me,
  1022  And hedg'd me by his wit to yeelde my selfe
  1023  His wife, who wins me by that meanes I told you,
  1024  Your selfe (renowned Prince) than stood as faire
  1025  As any commer I haue look'd on yet
  1026  For my affection
  1027  
  1028     Mor. Euen for that I thanke you,
  1029  Therefore I pray you leade me to the Caskets
  1030  To trie my fortune: By this Symitare
  1031  That slew the Sophie, and a Persian Prince
  1032  That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
  1033  I would ore-stare the sternest eies that looke:
  1034  Out-braue the heart most daring on the earth:
  1035  Plucke the yong sucking Cubs from the she Beare,
  1036  Yea, mocke the Lion when he rores for pray
  1037  To win the Ladie. But alas, the while
  1038  If Hercules and Lychas plaie at dice
  1039  Which is the better man, the greater throw
  1040  May turne by fortune from the weaker hand:
  1041  So is Alcides beaten by his rage,
  1042  And so may I, blinde fortune leading me
  1043  Misse that which one vnworthier may attaine,
  1044  And die with grieuing
  1045  
  1046     Port. You must take your chance,
  1047  And either not attempt to choose at all,
  1048  Or sweare before you choose, if you choose wrong
  1049  Neuer to speake to Ladie afterward
  1050  In way of marriage, therefore be aduis'd
  1051  
  1052     Mor. Nor will not, come bring me vnto my chance
  1053  
  1054     Por. First forward to the temple, after dinner
  1055  Your hazard shall be made
  1056  
  1057     Mor. Good fortune then,
  1058  
  1059  Cornets.
  1060  
  1061  To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
  1062  
  1063  Exeunt.
  1064  
  1065  Enter the Clowne alone.
  1066  
  1067    Clo. Certainely, my conscience will serue me to run
  1068  from this Iew my Maister: the fiend is at mine elbow,
  1069  and tempts me, saying to me, Iobbe, Launcelet Iobbe, good
  1070  Launcelet, or good Iobbe, or good Launcelet Iobbe, vse
  1071  your legs, take the start, run awaie: my conscience saies
  1072  no; take heede honest Launcelet, take heed honest Iobbe,
  1073  or as afore-said honest Launcelet Iobbe, doe not runne,
  1074  scorne running with thy heeles; well, the most coragious
  1075  fiend bids me packe, fia saies the fiend, away saies
  1076  the fiend, for the heauens rouse vp a braue minde saies
  1077  the fiend, and run; well, my conscience hanging about
  1078  the necke of my heart, saies verie wisely to me: my honest
  1079  friend Launcelet, being an honest mans sonne, or rather
  1080  an honest womans sonne, for indeede my Father did
  1081  something smack, something grow too; he had a kinde of
  1082  taste; wel, my conscience saies Lancelet bouge not, bouge
  1083  saies the fiend, bouge not saies my conscience, conscience
  1084  say I you counsaile well, fiend say I you counsaile well,
  1085  to be rul'd by my conscience I should stay with the Iew
  1086  my Maister, (who God blesse the marke) is a kinde of diuell;
  1087  and to run away from the Iew I should be ruled by
  1088  the fiend, who sauing your reuerence is the diuell himselfe:
  1089  certainely the Iew is the verie diuell incarnation,
  1090  and in my conscience, my conscience is a kinde of hard
  1091  conscience, to offer to counsaile me to stay with the Iew;
  1092  the fiend giues the more friendly counsaile: I will runne
  1093  fiend, my heeles are at your commandement, I will
  1094  runne.
  1095  Enter old Gobbe with a Basket.
  1096  
  1097    Gob. Maister yong-man, you I praie you, which is the
  1098  waie to Maister Iewes?
  1099    Lan. O heauens, this is my true begotten Father, who
  1100  being more then sand-blinde, high grauel blinde, knows
  1101  me not, I will trie confusions with him
  1102  
  1103  
  1104     Gob. Maister yong Gentleman, I praie you which is
  1105  the waie to Maister Iewes
  1106  
  1107     Laun. Turne vpon your right hand at the next turning,
  1108  but at the next turning of all on your left; marrie
  1109  at the verie next turning, turne of no hand, but turn down
  1110  indirectlie to the Iewes house
  1111  
  1112     Gob. Be Gods sonties 'twill be a hard waie to hit, can
  1113  you tell me whether one Launcelet that dwels with him
  1114  dwell with him or no
  1115  
  1116     Laun. Talke you of yong Master Launcelet, marke
  1117  me now, now will I raise the waters; talke you of yong
  1118  Maister Launcelet?
  1119    Gob. No Maister sir, but a poore mans sonne, his Father
  1120  though I say't is an honest exceeding poore man,
  1121  and God be thanked well to liue
  1122  
  1123     Lan. Well, let his Father be what a will, wee talke of
  1124  yong Maister Launcelet
  1125  
  1126     Gob. Your worships friend and Launcelet
  1127  
  1128     Laun. But I praie you ergo old man, ergo I beseech you,
  1129  talke you of yong Maister Launcelet
  1130  
  1131     Gob. Of Launcelet, ant please your maistership
  1132  
  1133     Lan. Ergo Maister Lancelet, talke not of maister Lancelet
  1134  Father, for the yong gentleman according to fates and
  1135  destinies, and such odde sayings, the sisters three, & such
  1136  branches of learning, is indeede deceased, or as you
  1137  would say in plaine tearmes, gone to heauen
  1138  
  1139     Gob. Marrie God forbid, the boy was the verie staffe
  1140  of my age, my verie prop
  1141  
  1142     Lau. Do I look like a cudgell or a houell-post, a staffe
  1143  or a prop: doe you know me Father
  1144  
  1145     Gob. Alacke the day, I know you not yong Gentleman,
  1146  but I praie you tell me, is my boy God rest his soule
  1147  aliue or dead
  1148  
  1149     Lan. Doe you not know me Father
  1150  
  1151     Gob. Alacke sir I am sand blinde, I know you not
  1152  
  1153     Lan. Nay, indeede if you had your eies you might
  1154  faile of the knowing me: it is a wise Father that knowes
  1155  his owne childe. Well, old man, I will tell you newes of
  1156  your son, giue me your blessing, truth will come to light,
  1157  murder cannot be hid long, a mans sonne may, but in the
  1158  end truth will out
  1159  
  1160     Gob. Praie you sir stand vp, I am sure you are not
  1161  Lancelet my boy
  1162  
  1163     Lan. Praie you let's haue no more fooling about
  1164  it, but giue mee your blessing: I am Lancelet your
  1165  boy that was, your sonne that is, your childe that
  1166  shall be
  1167  
  1168     Gob. I cannot thinke you are my sonne
  1169  
  1170     Lan. I know not what I shall thinke of that: but I am
  1171  Lancelet the Iewes man, and I am sure Margerie your wife
  1172  is my mother
  1173  
  1174     Gob. Her name is Margerie indeede, Ile be sworne if
  1175  thou be Lancelet, thou art mine owne flesh and blood:
  1176  Lord worshipt might he be, what a beard hast thou got;
  1177  thou hast got more haire on thy chin, then Dobbin my
  1178  philhorse has on his taile
  1179  
  1180     Lan. It should seeme then that Dobbins taile
  1181  growes backeward. I am sure he had more haire of his
  1182  taile then I haue of my face when I last saw him
  1183  
  1184     Gob. Lord how art thou chang'd: how doost thou
  1185  and thy Master agree, I haue brought him a present; how
  1186  gree you now?
  1187    Lan. Well, well, but for mine owne part, as I haue set
  1188  vp my rest to run awaie, so I will not rest till I haue run
  1189  some ground; my Maister's a verie Iew, giue him a present,
  1190  giue him a halter, I am famisht in his seruice. You
  1191  may tell euerie finger I haue with my ribs: Father I am
  1192  glad you are come, giue me your present to one Maister
  1193  Bassanio, who indeede giues rare new Liuories, if I serue
  1194  not him, I will run as far as God has anie ground. O rare
  1195  fortune, here comes the man, to him Father, for I am a
  1196  Iew if I serue the Iew anie longer.
  1197  Enter Bassanio with a follower or two.
  1198  
  1199    Bass. You may doe so, but let it be so hasted that
  1200  supper be readie at the farthest by fiue of the clocke:
  1201  see these Letters deliuered, put the Liueries to making,
  1202  and desire Gratiano to come anone to my lodging
  1203  
  1204     Lan. To him Father
  1205  
  1206     Gob. God blesse your worship
  1207  
  1208     Bass. Gramercie, would'st thou ought with me
  1209  
  1210     Gob. Here's my sonne sir, a poore boy
  1211  
  1212     Lan. Not a poore boy sir, but the rich Iewes man that
  1213  would sir as my Father shall specifie
  1214  
  1215     Gob. He hath a great infection sir, as one would say
  1216  to serue
  1217  
  1218     Lan. Indeede the short and the long is, I serue the
  1219  Iew, and haue a desire as my Father shall specifie
  1220  
  1221     Gob. His Maister and he (sauing your worships reuerence)
  1222  are scarce catercosins
  1223  
  1224     Lan. To be briefe, the verie truth is, that the Iew
  1225  hauing done me wrong, doth cause me as my Father being
  1226  I hope an old man shall frutifie vnto you
  1227  
  1228     Gob. I haue here a dish of Doues that I would bestow
  1229  vpon your worship, and my suite is
  1230  
  1231     Lan. In verie briefe, the suite is impertinent to my
  1232  selfe, as your worship shall know by this honest old man,
  1233  and though I say it, though old man, yet poore man my
  1234  Father
  1235  
  1236     Bass. One speake for both, what would you?
  1237    Lan. Serue you sir
  1238  
  1239     Gob. That is the verie defect of the matter sir
  1240  
  1241     Bass. I know thee well, thou hast obtain'd thy suite,
  1242  Shylocke thy Maister spoke with me this daie,
  1243  And hath prefer'd thee, if it be preferment
  1244  To leaue a rich Iewes seruice, to become
  1245  The follower of so poore a Gentleman
  1246  
  1247     Clo. The old prouerbe is verie well parted betweene
  1248  my Maister Shylocke and you sir, you haue the grace of
  1249  God sir, and he hath enough
  1250  
  1251     Bass. Thou speak'st well; go Father with thy Son,
  1252  Take leaue of thy old Maister, and enquire
  1253  My lodging out, giue him a Liuerie
  1254  More garded then his fellowes: see it done
  1255  
  1256     Clo. Father in, I cannot get a seruice, no, I haue nere
  1257  a tongue in my head, well: if anie man in Italie haue a
  1258  fairer table which doth offer to sweare vpon a booke, I
  1259  shall haue good fortune; goe too, here's a simple line
  1260  of life, here's a small trifle of wiues, alas, fifteene wiues
  1261  is nothing, a leuen widdowes and nine maides is a simple
  1262  comming in for one man, and then to scape drowning
  1263  thrice, and to be in perill of my life with the edge
  1264  of a featherbed, here are simple scapes: well, if Fortune
  1265  be a woman, she's a good wench for this gere: Father
  1266  come, Ile take my leaue of the Iew in the twinkling.
  1267  
  1268  Exit Clowne.
  1269  
  1270    Bass. I praie thee good Leonardo thinke on this,
  1271  These things being bought and orderly bestowed
  1272  Returne in haste, for I doe feast to night
  1273  My best esteemd acquaintance, hie thee goe
  1274

  1276  
  1277  Exit Le.
  1278  
  1279  Enter Gratiano.
  1280  
  1281    Gra. Where's your Maister
  1282  
  1283     Leon. Yonder sir he walkes
  1284  
  1285     Gra. Signior Bassanio
  1286  
  1287     Bas. Gratiano
  1288  
  1289     Gra. I haue a sute to you
  1290  
  1291     Bass. You haue obtain'd it
  1292  
  1293     Gra. You must not denie me, I must goe with you to
  1294  Belmont
  1295  
  1296     Bass. Why then you must: but heare thee Gratiano,
  1297  Thou art to wilde, to rude, and bold of voyce,
  1298  Parts that become thee happily enough,
  1299  And in such eyes as ours appeare not faults;
  1300  But where they are not knowne, why there they show
  1301  Something too liberall, pray thee take paine
  1302  To allay with some cold drops of modestie
  1303  Thy skipping spirit, least through thy wilde behauiour
  1304  I be misconsterd in the place I goe to,
  1305  And loose my hopes
  1306  
  1307     Gra. Signor Bassanio, heare me,
  1308  If I doe not put on a sober habite,
  1309  Talke with respect, and sweare but now and than,
  1310  Weare prayer bookes in my pocket, looke demurely,
  1311  Nay more, while grace is saying hood mine eyes
  1312  Thus with my hat, and sigh and say Amen:
  1313  Vse all the obseruance of ciuillitie
  1314  Like one well studied in a sad ostent
  1315  To please his Grandam, neuer trust me more
  1316  
  1317     Bas. Well, we shall see your bearing
  1318  
  1319     Gra. Nay but I barre to night, you shall not gage me
  1320  By what we doe to night
  1321  
  1322     Bas. No that were pittie,
  1323  I would intreate you rather to put on
  1324  Your boldest suite of mirth, for we haue friends
  1325  That purpose merriment: but far you well,
  1326  I haue some businesse
  1327

  1331  Exeunt.
  1332  
  1333  Enter Iessica and the Clowne.
  1334  
  1335    Ies. I am sorry thou wilt leaue my Father so,
  1336  Our house is hell, and thou a merrie diuell
  1337  Did'st rob it of some taste of tediousnesse;
  1338  But far thee well, there is a ducat for thee,
  1339  And Lancelet, soone at supper shalt thou see
  1340  Lorenzo, who is thy new Maisters guest,
  1341  Giue him this Letter, doe it secretly,
  1342  And so farewell: I would not haue my Father
  1343  see me talke with thee
  1344  
  1345  
  1346     Clo. Adue, teares exhibit my tongue, most beautifull
  1347  Pagan, most sweete Iew, if a Christian doe not play the
  1348  knaue and get thee, I am much deceiued; but adue, these
  1349  foolish drops doe somewhat drowne my manly spirit:
  1350  adue.
  1351  Enter.
  1352  
  1353    Ies. Farewell good Lancelet.
  1354  Alacke, what hainous sinne is it in me
  1355  To be ashamed to be my Fathers childe,
  1356  But though I am a daughter to his blood,
  1357  I am not to his manners: O Lorenzo,
  1358  If thou keepe promise I shall end this strife,
  1359  Become a Christian, and thy louing wife.
  1360  Enter.
  1361  
  1362  Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salarino, and Salanio.
  1363  
  1364    Lor. Nay, we will slinke away in supper time,
  1365  Disguise vs at my lodging, and returne all in an houre
  1366  
  1367     Gra. We haue not made good preparation
  1368  
  1369     Sal. We haue not spoke vs yet of Torch-bearers
  1370  
  1371     Sol. 'Tis vile vnlesse it may be quaintly ordered,
  1372  And better in my minde not vndertooke
  1373  
  1374     Lor. 'Tis now but foure of clock, we haue two houres
  1375  To furnish vs; friend Lancelet what's the newes.
  1376  Enter Lancelet with a Letter.
  1377  
  1378    Lan. And it shall please you to breake vp this, shall it
  1379  seeme to signifie
  1380  
  1381     Lor. I know the hand, in faith 'tis a faire hand
  1382  And whiter then the paper it writ on,
  1383  Is the faire hand that writ
  1384  
  1385     Gra. Loue newes in faith
  1386  
  1387     Lan. By your leaue sir
  1388  
  1389     Lor. Whither goest thou?
  1390    Lan. Marry sir to bid my old Master the Iew to sup
  1391  to night with my new Master the Christian
  1392  
  1393     Lor. Hold here, take this, tell gentle Iessica
  1394  I will not faile her, speake it priuately:
  1395  Go Gentlemen, will you prepare you for this Maske to
  1396  night,
  1397  I am prouided of a Torch-bearer.
  1398  
  1399  Exit. Clowne
  1400  
  1401     Sal. I marry, ile be gone about it strait
  1402  
  1403     Sol. And so will I
  1404  
  1405     Lor. Meete me and Gratiano at Gratianos lodging
  1406  Some houre hence
  1407  
  1408     Sal. 'Tis good we do so.
  1409  Enter.
  1410  
  1411    Gra. Was not that Letter from faire Iessica?
  1412    Lor. I must needes tell thee all, she hath directed
  1413  How I shall take her from her Fathers house,
  1414  What gold and iewels she is furnisht with,
  1415  What Pages suite she hath in readinesse:
  1416  If ere the Iew her Father come to heauen,
  1417  It will be for his gentle daughters sake;
  1418  And neuer dare misfortune crosse her foote,
  1419  Vnlesse she doe it vnder this excuse,
  1420  That she is issue to a faithlesse Iew:
  1421  Come goe with me, pervse this as thou goest,
  1422  Faire Iessica shall be my Torch-bearer.
  1423  Enter.
  1424  
  1425  Enter Iew, and his man that was the Clowne.
  1426  
  1427    Iew. Well, thou shall see, thy eyes shall be thy iudge,
  1428  The difference of old Shylocke and Bassanio;
  1429  What Iessica, thou shalt not gurmandize
  1430  As thou hast done with me: what Iessica?
  1431  And sleepe, and snore, and rend apparrell out.
  1432  Why Iessica I say
  1433  
  1434     Clo. Why Iessica
  1435  
  1436     Shy. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call
  1437  
  1438     Clo. Your worship was wont to tell me
  1439  I could doe nothing without bidding.
  1440  Enter Iessica.
  1441  
  1442    Ies. Call you? what is your will?
  1443    Shy. I am bid forth to supper Iessica,
  1444  There are my Keyes: but wherefore should I go?
  1445  I am not bid for loue, they flatter me,
  1446  But yet Ile goe in hate, to feede vpon
  1447  The prodigall Christian. Iessica my girle,
  1448  Looke to my house, I am right loath to goe,
  1449  There is some ill a bruing towards my rest,
  1450  For I did dreame of money bags to night
  1451  
  1452     Clo. I beseech you sir goe, my yong Master
  1453  Doth expect your reproach
  1454  
  1455     Shy. So doe I his
  1456  
  1457     Clo. And they haue conspired together, I will not say
  1458  you shall see a Maske, but if you doe, then it was not for
  1459  nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on blacke monday
  1460  last, at six a clocke ith morning, falling out that yeere on
  1461  ashwensday was foure yeere in th' afternoone
  1462  
  1463     Shy. What are their maskes? heare you me Iessica,
  1464  Lock vp my doores, and when you heare the drum
  1465  And the vile squealing of the wry-neckt Fife,
  1466  Clamber not you vp to the casements then,
  1467  Nor thrust your head into the publique streete
  1468  To gaze on Christian fooles with varnisht faces:
  1469  But stop my houses eares, I meane my casements,
  1470  Let not the sound of shallow fopperie enter
  1471  My sober house. By Iacobs staffe I sweare,
  1472  I haue no minde of feasting forth to night:
  1473  But I will goe: goe you before me sirra,
  1474  Say I will come
  1475  
  1476     Clo. I will goe before sir,
  1477  Mistris looke out at window for all this;
  1478  There will come a Christian by,
  1479  Will be worth a Iewes eye
  1480  
  1481     Shy. What saies that foole of Hagars off-spring?
  1482  ha
  1483  
  1484     Ies. His words were farewell mistris, nothing else
  1485  
  1486     Shy. The patch is kinde enough, but a huge feeder:
  1487  Snaile-slow in profit, but he sleepes by day
  1488  More then the wilde-cat: drones hiue not with me,
  1489  Therefore I part with him, and part with him
  1490  To one that I would haue him helpe to waste
  1491  His borrowed purse. Well Iessica goe in,
  1492  Perhaps I will returne immediately;
  1493  Doe as I bid you, shut dores after you, fast binde, fast
  1494  finde,
  1495  A prouerbe neuer stale in thriftie minde.
  1496  Enter.
  1497  
  1498    Ies. Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost,
  1499  I haue a Father, you a daughter lost.
  1500  Enter.
  1501  
  1502  Enter the Maskers, Gratiano and Salino.
  1503  
  1504    Gra. This is the penthouse vnder which Lorenzo
  1505  Desired vs to make a stand
  1506  
  1507     Sal. His houre is almost past
  1508  
  1509     Gra. And it is meruaile he out-dwels his houre,
  1510  For louers euer run before the clocke
  1511  
  1512     Sal. O ten times faster Venus Pidgions flye
  1513  To steale loues bonds new made, then they are wont
  1514  To keepe obliged faith vnforfaited
  1515  
  1516     Gra. That euer holds, who riseth from a feast
  1517  With that keene appetite that he sits downe?
  1518  Where is the horse that doth vntread againe
  1519  His tedious measures with the vnbated fire,
  1520  That he did pace them first: all things that are,
  1521  Are with more spirit chased then enioy'd.
  1522  How like a yonger or a prodigall
  1523  The skarfed barke puts from her natiue bay,
  1524  Hudg'd and embraced by the strumpet winde:
  1525  How like a prodigall doth she returne
  1526  With ouer-wither'd ribs and ragged sailes,
  1527  Leane, rent, and begger'd by the strumpet winde?
  1528  Enter Lorenzo.
  1529  
  1530    Salino. Heere comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter
  1531  
  1532     Lor. Sweete friends, your patience for my long abode,
  1533  Not I, but my affaires haue made you wait;
  1534  When you shall please to play the theeues for wiues
  1535  Ile watch as long for you then: approach
  1536  Here dwels my father Iew. Hoa, who's within?
  1537  
  1538  Iessica aboue.
  1539  
  1540    Iess. Who are you? tell me for more certainty,
  1541  Albeit Ile sweare that I do know your tongue
  1542  
  1543     Lor. Lorenzo, and thy Loue
  1544  
  1545     Ies. Lorenzo certaine, and my loue indeed,
  1546  For who loue I so much? and now who knowes
  1547  But you Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
  1548    Lor. Heauen and thy thoughts are witness that thou
  1549  art
  1550  
  1551     Ies. Heere, catch this casket, it is worth the paines,
  1552  I am glad 'tis night, you do not looke on me,
  1553  For I am much asham'd of my exchange:
  1554  But loue is blinde, and louers cannot see
  1555  The pretty follies that themselues commit,
  1556  For if they could, Cupid himselfe would blush
  1557  To see me thus transformed to a boy
  1558  
  1559     Lor. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer
  1560  
  1561     Ies. What, must I hold a Candle to my shames?
  1562  They in themselues goodsooth are too too light.
  1563  Why, 'tis an office of discouery Loue,
  1564  And I should be obscur'd
  1565  
  1566     Lor. So you are sweet,
  1567  Euen in the louely garnish of a boy: but come at once,
  1568  For the close night doth play the run-away,
  1569  And we are staid for at Bassanio's feast
  1570  
  1571     Ies. I will make fast the doores and guild my selfe
  1572  With some more ducats, and be with you straight
  1573  
  1574     Gra. Now by my hood, a gentle, and no Iew
  1575  
  1576     Lor. Beshrew me but I loue her heartily.
  1577  For she is wise, if I can iudge of her.
  1578  And faire she is, if that mine eyes be true,
  1579  And true she is, as she hath prou'd her selfe:
  1580  And therefore like her selfe, wise, faire, and true,
  1581  Shall she be placed in my constant soule.
  1582  Enter Iessica.
  1583  
  1584  What, art thou come? on gentlemen, away,
  1585  Our masking mates by this time for vs stay.
  1586  Enter.
  1587  
  1588  Enter Anthonio.
  1589  
  1590    Ant. Who's there?
  1591    Gra. Signior Anthonio?
  1592    Ant. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
  1593  'Tis nine a clocke, our friends all stay for you,
  1594  No maske to night, the winde is come about,
  1595  Bassanio presently will goe aboord,
  1596  I haue sent twenty out to seeke for you
  1597  
  1598     Gra. I am glad on't, I desire no more delight
  1599  Then to be vnder saile, and gone to night.
  1600  
  1601  Exeunt.
  1602  
  1603  Enter Portia with Morrocho, and both their traines.
  1604  
  1605    Por. Goe, draw aside the curtaines, and discouer
  1606  The seuerall Caskets to this noble Prince:
  1607  Now make your choyse
  1608  
  1609     Mor. The first of gold, who this inscription beares,
  1610  Who chooseth me, shall gaine what men desire.
  1611  The second siluer, which this promise carries,
  1612  Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.
  1613  This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
  1614  Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.
  1615  How shall I know if I doe choose the right?
  1616  How shall I know if I doe choose the right
  1617  
  1618     Por. The one of them containes my picture Prince,
  1619  If you choose that, then I am yours withall
  1620  
  1621     Mor. Some God direct my iudgement, let me see,
  1622  I will suruay the inscriptions, backe againe:
  1623  What saies this leaden casket?
  1624  Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.
  1625  Must giue, for what? for lead, hazard for lead?
  1626  This casket threatens men that hazard all
  1627  Doe it in hope of faire aduantages:
  1628  A golden minde stoopes not to showes of drosse,
  1629  Ile then nor giue nor hazard ought for lead.
  1630  What saies the Siluer with her virgin hue?
  1631  Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.
  1632  As much as he deserues; pause there Morocho,
  1633  And weigh thy value with an euen hand,
  1634  If thou beest rated by thy estimation
  1635  Thou doost deserue enough, and yet enough
  1636  May not extend so farre as to the Ladie:
  1637  And yet to be afeard of my deseruing,
  1638  Were but a weake disabling of my selfe.
  1639  As much as I deserue, why that's the Lady.
  1640  I doe in birth deserue her, and in fortunes,
  1641  In graces, and in qualities of breeding:
  1642  But more then these, in loue I doe deserue.
  1643  What if I strai'd no farther, but chose here?
  1644  Let's see once more this saying grau'd in gold.
  1645  Who chooseth me shall gaine what many men desire:
  1646  Why that's the Lady, all the world desires her:
  1647  From the foure corners of the earth they come
  1648  To kisse this shrine, this mortall breathing Saint.
  1649  The Hircanion deserts, and the vaste wildes
  1650  Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
  1651  For Princes to come view faire Portia.
  1652  The waterie Kingdome, whose ambitious head
  1653  Spets in the face of heauen, is no barre
  1654  To stop the forraine spirits, but they come
  1655  As ore a brooke to see faire Portia.
  1656  One of these three containes her heauenly picture.
  1657  Is't like that Lead containes her? 'twere damnation
  1658  To thinke so base a thought, it were too grose
  1659  To rib her searecloath in the obscure graue:
  1660  Or shall I thinke in Siluer she's immur'd
  1661  Being ten times vndervalued to tride gold;
  1662  O sinfull thought, neuer so rich a Iem
  1663  Was set in worse then gold! They haue in England
  1664  A coyne that beares the figure of an Angell
  1665  Stampt in gold, but that's insculpt vpon:
  1666  But here an Angell in a golden bed
  1667  Lies all within. Deliuer me the key:
  1668  Here doe I choose, and thriue I as I may
  1669  
  1670     Por. There take it Prince, and if my forme lye there
  1671  Then I am yours
  1672  
  1673     Mor. O hell! what haue we here, a carrion death,
  1674  Within whose emptie eye there is a written scroule;
  1675  Ile reade the writing.
  1676  All that glisters is not gold,
  1677  Often haue you heard that told;
  1678  Many a man his life hath sold
  1679  But my outside to behold;
  1680  Guilded timber doe wormes infold:
  1681  Had you beene as wise as bold,
  1682  Yong in limbs, in iudgement old,
  1683  Your answere had not beene inscrold,
  1684  Fareyouwell, your suite is cold,
  1685    Mor. Cold indeede, and labour lost,
  1686  Then farewell heate, and welcome frost:
  1687  Portia adew, I haue too grieu'd a heart
  1688  To take a tedious leaue: thus loosers part.
  1689  Enter.
  1690  
  1691    Por. A gentle riddance: draw the curtaines, go:
  1692  Let all of his complexion choose me so.
  1693  
  1694  Exeunt.
  1695  
  1696  Enter Salarino and Solanio.
  1697  
  1698    Flo. Cornets
  1699  
  1700     Sal. Why man I saw Bassanio vnder sayle;
  1701  With him is Gratiano gone along;
  1702  And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not
  1703  
  1704     Sol. The villaine Iew with outcries raisd the Duke.
  1705  Who went with him to search Bassanios ship
  1706  
  1707     Sal. He comes too late, the ship was vndersaile;
  1708  But there the Duke was giuen to vnderstand
  1709  That in a Gondilo were seene together
  1710  Lorenzo and his amorous Iessica.
  1711  Besides, Anthonio certified the Duke
  1712  They were not with Bassanio in his ship
  1713  
  1714     Sol. I neuer heard a passion so confusd,
  1715  So strange, outragious, and so variable,
  1716  As the dogge Iew did vtter in the streets;
  1717  My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter,
  1718  Fled with a Christian, O my Christian ducats!
  1719  Iustice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter;
  1720  A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
  1721  Of double ducats, stolne from me by my daughter,
  1722  And iewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
  1723  Stolne by my daughter: iustice, finde the girle,
  1724  She hath the stones vpon her, and the ducats
  1725  
  1726     Sal. Why all the boyes in Venice follow him,
  1727  Crying his stones, his daughter, and his ducats
  1728  
  1729     Sol. Let good Anthonio looke he keepe his day
  1730  Or he shall pay for this
  1731  
  1732     Sal. Marry well remembred,
  1733  I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
  1734  Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
  1735  The French and English, there miscaried
  1736  A vessell of our countrey richly fraught:
  1737  I thought vpon Anthonio when he told me,
  1738  And wisht in silence that it were not his
  1739  
  1740     Sol. You were best to tell Anthonio what you heare.
  1741  Yet doe not suddainely, for it may grieue him
  1742  
  1743     Sal. A kinder Gentleman treads not the earth,
  1744  I saw Bassanio and Anthonio part,
  1745  Bassanio told him he would make some speede
  1746  Of his returne: he answered, doe not so,
  1747  Slubber not businesse for my sake Bassanio,
  1748  But stay the very riping of the time,
  1749  And for the Iewes bond which he hath of me,
  1750  Let it not enter in your minde of loue:
  1751  Be merry, and imploy your chiefest thoughts
  1752  To courtship, and such faire ostents of loue
  1753  As shall conueniently become you there;
  1754  And euen there his eye being big with teares,
  1755  Turning his face, he put his hand behinde him,
  1756  And with affection wondrous sencible
  1757  He wrung Bassanios hand, and so they parted
  1758  
  1759     Sol. I thinke he onely loues the world for him,
  1760  I pray thee let vs goe and finde him out
  1761  And quicken his embraced heauinesse
  1762  With some delight or other
  1763  
  1764     Sal. Doe we so.
  1765  
  1766  Exeunt.
  1767  
  1768  Enter Nerrissa and a Seruiture.
  1769  
  1770    Ner. Quick, quick I pray thee, draw the curtain strait,
  1771  The Prince of Arragon hath tane his oath,
  1772  And comes to his election presently.
  1773  Enter Arragon, his traine, and Portia. Flor. Cornets.
  1774  
  1775    Por. Behold, there stand the caskets noble Prince,
  1776  If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
  1777  Straight shall our nuptiall rights be solemniz'd:
  1778  But if thou faile, without more speech my Lord,
  1779  You must be gone from hence immediately
  1780  
  1781     Ar. I am enioynd by oath to obserue three things;
  1782  First, neuer to vnfold to any one
  1783  Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I faile
  1784  Of the right casket, neuer in my life
  1785  To wooe a maide in way of marriage:
  1786  Lastly, if I doe faile in fortune of my choyse,
  1787  Immediately to leaue you, and be gone
  1788  
  1789     Por. To these iniunctions euery one doth sweare
  1790  That comes to hazard for my worthlesse selfe
  1791  
  1792     Ar. And so haue I addrest me, fortune now
  1793  To my hearts hope: gold, siluer, and base lead.
  1794  Who chooseth me must giue and hazard all he hath.
  1795  You shall looke fairer ere I giue or hazard.
  1796  What saies the golden chest, ha, let me see.
  1797  Who chooseth me, shall gaine what many men desire:
  1798  What many men desire, that many may be meant
  1799  By the foole multitude that choose by show,
  1800  Not learning more then the fond eye doth teach,
  1801  Which pries not to th' interior, but like the Martlet
  1802  Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
  1803  Euen in the force and rode of casualtie.
  1804  I will not choose what many men desire,
  1805  Because I will not iumpe with common spirits,
  1806  And ranke me with the barbarous multitudes.
  1807  Why then to thee thou Siluer treasure house,
  1808  Tell me once more, what title thou doost beare;
  1809  Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues:
  1810  And well said too; for who shall goe about
  1811  To cosen Fortune, and be honourable
  1812  Without the stampe of merrit, let none presume
  1813  To weare an vndeserued dignitie:
  1814  O that estates, degrees, and offices,
  1815  Were not deriu'd corruptly, and that cleare honour
  1816  Were purchast by the merrit of the wearer;
  1817  How many then should couer that stand bare?
  1818  How many be commanded that command?
  1819  How much low pleasantry would then be gleaned
  1820  From the true seede of honor? And how much honor
  1821  Pickt from the chaffe and ruine of the times,
  1822  To be new varnisht: Well, but to my choise.
  1823  Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues.
  1824  I will assume desert; giue me a key for this,
  1825  And instantly vnlocke my fortunes here
  1826  
  1827     Por. Too long a pause for that which you finde there
  1828  
  1829     Ar. What's here, the portrait of a blinking idiot
  1830  Presenting me a scedule, I will reade it:
  1831  How much vnlike art thou to Portia?
  1832  How much vnlike my hopes and my deseruings?
  1833  Who chooseth me, shall haue as much as he deserues.
  1834  Did I deserue no more then a fooles head,
  1835  Is that my prize, are my deserts no better?
  1836    Por. To offend and iudge are distinct offices,
  1837  And of opposed natures
  1838  
  1839     Ar. What is here?
  1840  The fier seauen times tried this,
  1841  Seauen times tried that iudgement is,
  1842  That did neuer choose amis,
  1843  Some there be that shadowes kisse,
  1844  Such haue but a shadowes blisse:
  1845  There be fooles aliue Iwis
  1846  Siluer'd o're, and so was this:
  1847  Take what wife you will to bed,
  1848  I will euer be your head:
  1849  So be gone, you are sped
  1850  
  1851     Ar. Still more foole I shall appeare
  1852  By the time I linger here,
  1853  With one fooles head I came to woo,
  1854  But I goe away with two.
  1855  Sweet adue, Ile keepe my oath,
  1856  Patiently to beare my wroath
  1857  
  1858     Por. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moath:
  1859  O these deliberate fooles when they doe choose,
  1860  They haue the wisdome by their wit to loose
  1861  
  1862     Ner. The ancient saying is no heresie,
  1863  Hanging and wiuing goes by destinie
  1864  
  1865     Por. Come draw the curtaine Nerrissa.
  1866  Enter Messenger.
  1867  
  1868    Mes. Where is my Lady?
  1869    Por. Here, what would my Lord?
  1870    Mes. Madam, there is a-lighted at your gate
  1871  A yong Venetian, one that comes before
  1872  To signifie th' approaching of his Lord,
  1873  From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;
  1874  To wit (besides commends and curteous breath)
  1875  Gifts of rich value; yet I haue not seene
  1876  So likely an Embassador of loue.
  1877  A day in Aprill neuer came so sweete
  1878  To show how costly Sommer was at hand,
  1879  As this fore-spurrer comes before his Lord
  1880  
  1881     Por. No more I pray thee, I am halfe a-feard
  1882  Thou wilt say anone he is some kin to thee,
  1883  Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him:
  1884  Come, come Nerryssa, for I long to see
  1885  Quicke Cupids Post, that comes so mannerly
  1886  
  1887     Ner. Bassanio Lord, loue if thy will it be.
  1888  
  1889  Exeunt.
  1890  
  1891  
  1892  Actus Tertius.
  1893  
  1894  Enter Solanio and Salarino.
  1895  
  1896    Sol. Now, what newes on the Ryalto?
  1897    Sal. Why yet it liues there vncheckt, that Anthonio
  1898  hath a ship of rich lading wrackt on the narrow Seas; the
  1899  Goodwins I thinke they call the place, a very dangerous
  1900  flat, and fatall, where the carcasses of many a tall ship, lye
  1901  buried, as they say, if my gossips report be an honest woman
  1902  of her word
  1903  
  1904     Sol. I would she were as lying a gossip in that, as euer
  1905  knapt Ginger, or made her neighbours beleeue she wept
  1906  for the death of a third husband: but it is true, without
  1907  any slips of prolixity, or crossing the plaine high-way of
  1908  talke, that the good Anthonio, the honest Anthonio; o that
  1909  I had a title good enough to keepe his name company!
  1910    Sal. Come, the full stop
  1911  
  1912     Sol. Ha, what sayest thou, why the end is, he hath lost
  1913  a ship
  1914  
  1915     Sal. I would it might proue the end of his losses
  1916  
  1917     Sol. Let me say Amen betimes, least the diuell crosse
  1918  my praier, for here he comes in the likenes of a Iew. How
  1919  now Shylocke, what newes among the Merchants?
  1920  Enter Shylocke.
  1921  
  1922    Shy. You knew none so well, none so well as you, of
  1923  my daughters flight
  1924  
  1925     Sal. That's certaine, I for my part knew the Tailor
  1926  that made the wings she flew withall
  1927  
  1928     Sol. And Shylocke for his owne part knew the bird was
  1929  fledg'd, and then it is the complexion of them al to leaue
  1930  the dam
  1931  
  1932     Shy. She is damn'd for it
  1933  
  1934     Sal. That's certaine, if the diuell may be her Iudge
  1935  
  1936     Shy. My owne flesh and blood to rebell
  1937  
  1938     Sol. Out vpon it old carrion, rebels it at these yeeres
  1939  
  1940     Shy. I say my daughter is my flesh and bloud
  1941  
  1942     Sal. There is more difference betweene thy flesh and
  1943  hers, then betweene Iet and Iuorie, more betweene your
  1944  bloods, then there is betweene red wine and rennish: but
  1945  tell vs, doe you heare whether Anthonio haue had anie
  1946  losse at sea or no?
  1947    Shy. There I haue another bad match, a bankrout, a
  1948  prodigall, who dare scarce shew his head on the Ryalto,
  1949  a begger that was vsd to come so smug vpon the Mart:
  1950  let him look to his bond, he was wont to call me Vsurer,
  1951  let him looke to his bond, he was wont to lend money
  1952  for a Christian curtsie, let him looke to his bond
  1953  
  1954     Sal. Why I am sure if he forfaite, thou wilt not take
  1955  his flesh, what's that good for?
  1956    Shy. To baite fish withall, if it will feede nothing
  1957  else, it will feede my reuenge; he hath disgrac'd me, and
  1958  hindred me halfe a million, laught at my losses, mockt at
  1959  my gaines, scorned my Nation, thwarted my bargaines,
  1960  cooled my friends, heated mine enemies, and what's the
  1961  reason? I am a Iewe: Hath not a Iew eyes? hath not a
  1962  Iew hands, organs, dementions, sences, affections, passions,
  1963  fed with the same foode, hurt with the same weapons,
  1964  subiect to the same diseases, healed by the same
  1965  meanes, warmed and cooled by the same Winter and
  1966  Sommer as a Christian is: if you pricke vs doe we not
  1967  bleede? if you tickle vs, doe we not laugh? if you poison
  1968  vs doe we not die? and if you wrong vs shall we not reuenge?
  1969  if we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
  1970  in that. If a Iew wrong a Christian, what is his humility,
  1971  reuenge? If a Christian wrong a Iew, what should his sufferance
  1972  be by Christian example, why reuenge? The villanie
  1973  you teach me I will execute, and it shall goe hard
  1974  but I will better the instruction.
  1975  Enter a man from Anthonio.
  1976  
  1977  Gentlemen, my maister Anthonio is at his house, and
  1978  desires to speake with you both
  1979  
  1980     Sal. We haue beene vp and downe to seeke him.
  1981  Enter Tuball.
  1982  
  1983    Sol. Here comes another of the Tribe, a third cannot
  1984  be matcht, vnlesse the diuell himselfe turne Iew.
  1985  
  1986  Exeunt. Gentlemen
  1987  
  1988     Shy. How now Tuball, what newes from Genowa? hast
  1989  thou found my daughter?
  1990    Tub. I often came where I did heare of her, but cannot
  1991  finde her
  1992  
  1993     Shy. Why there, there, there, there, a diamond gone
  1994  cost me two thousand ducats in Franckford, the curse neuer
  1995  fell vpon our Nation till now, I neuer felt it till now,
  1996  two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious
  1997  iewels: I would my daughter were dead at my foot,
  1998  and the iewels in her eare: would she were hearst at my
  1999  foote, and the duckets in her coffin: no newes of them,
  2000  why so? and I know not how much is spent in the search:
  2001  why thou losse vpon losse, the theefe gone with so
  2002  much, and so much to finde the theefe, and no satisfaction,
  2003  no reuenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights
  2004  a my shoulders, no sighes but a my breathing, no teares
  2005  but a my shedding
  2006  
  2007     Tub. Yes, other men haue ill lucke too, Anthonio as I
  2008  heard in Genowa?
  2009    Shy. What, what, what, ill lucke, ill lucke
  2010  
  2011     Tub. Hath an Argosie cast away comming from Tripolis
  2012  
  2013     Shy. I thanke God, I thanke God, is it true, is it true?
  2014    Tub. I spoke with some of the Saylers that escaped
  2015  the wracke
  2016  
  2017     Shy. I thanke thee good Tuball, good newes, good
  2018  newes: ha, ha, here in Genowa
  2019  
  2020     Tub. Your daughter spent in Genowa, as I heard, one
  2021  night fourescore ducats
  2022  
  2023     Shy. Thou stick'st a dagger in me, I shall neuer see my
  2024  gold againe, fourescore ducats at a sitting, fourescore ducats
  2025  
  2026     Tub. There came diuers of Anthonios creditors in my
  2027  company to Venice, that sweare hee cannot choose but
  2028  breake
  2029  
  2030     Shy. I am very glad of it, ile plague him, ile torture
  2031  him, I am glad of it,
  2032    Tub. One of them shewed me a ring that hee had of
  2033  your daughter for a Monkie
  2034  
  2035     Shy. Out vpon her, thou torturest me Tuball, it was
  2036  my Turkies, I had it of Leah when I was a Batcheler: I
  2037  would not haue giuen it for a wildernesse of Monkies
  2038  
  2039     Tub. But Anthonio is certainely vndone
  2040  
  2041     Shy. Nay, that's true, that's very true, goe Tuball, see
  2042  me an Officer, bespeake him a fortnight before, I will
  2043  haue the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice,
  2044  I can make what merchandize I will: goe Tuball,
  2045  and meete me at our Sinagogue, goe good Tuball, at our
  2046  Sinagogue Tuball.
  2047  
  2048  Exeunt.
  2049  
  2050  Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, and all their traine.
  2051  
  2052    Por. I pray you tarrie, pause a day or two
  2053  Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong
  2054  I loose your companie; therefore forbeare a while,
  2055  There's something tels me (but it is not loue)
  2056  I would not loose you, and you know your selfe,
  2057  Hate counsailes not in such a quallitie;
  2058  But least you should not vnderstand me well,
  2059  And yet a maiden hath no tongue, but thought,
  2060  I would detaine you here some month or two
  2061  Before you venture for me. I could teach you
  2062  How to choose right, but then I am forsworne,
  2063  So will I neuer be, so may you misse me,
  2064  But if you doe, youle make me wish a sinne,
  2065  That I had beene forsworne: Beshrow your eyes,
  2066  They haue ore-lookt me and deuided me,
  2067  One halfe of me is yours, the other halfe yours,
  2068  Mine owne I would say: but of mine then yours,
  2069  And so all yours; O these naughtie times
  2070  Puts bars betweene the owners and their rights.
  2071  And so though yours, not yours (proue it so)
  2072  Let Fortune goe to hell for it, not I.
  2073  I speake too long, but 'tis to peize the time,
  2074  To ich it, and to draw it out in length,
  2075  To stay you from election
  2076  
  2077     Bass. Let me choose,
  2078  For as I am, I liue vpon the racke
  2079  
  2080     Por. Vpon the racke Bassanio, then confesse
  2081  What treason there is mingled with your loue
  2082  
  2083     Bass. None but that vglie treason of mistrust.
  2084  Which makes me feare the enioying of my loue:
  2085  There may as well be amitie and life,
  2086  'Tweene snow and fire, as treason and my loue
  2087  
  2088     Por. I, but I feare you speake vpon the racke,
  2089  Where men enforced doth speake any thing
  2090  
  2091     Bass. Promise me life, and ile confesse the truth
  2092  
  2093     Por. Well then, confesse and liue
  2094  
  2095     Bass. Confesse and loue
  2096  Had beene the verie sum of my confession:
  2097  O happie torment, when my torturer
  2098  Doth teach me answers for deliuerance:
  2099  But let me to my fortune and the caskets
  2100  
  2101     Por. Away then, I am lockt in one of them,
  2102  If you doe loue me, you will finde me out.
  2103  Nerryssa and the rest, stand all aloofe,
  2104  Let musicke sound while he doth make his choise,
  2105  Then if he loose he makes a Swan-like end,
  2106  Fading in musique. That the comparison
  2107  May stand more proper, my eye shall be the streame
  2108  And watrie death-bed for him: he may win,
  2109  And what is musique than? Than musique is
  2110  Euen as the flourish, when true subiects bowe
  2111  To a new crowned Monarch: Such it is,
  2112  As are those dulcet sounds in breake of day,
  2113  That creepe into the dreaming bride-groomes eare,
  2114  And summon him to marriage. Now he goes
  2115  With no lesse presence, but with much more loue
  2116  Then yong Alcides, when he did redeeme
  2117  The virgine tribute, paied by howling Troy
  2118  To the Sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice,
  2119  The rest aloofe are the Dardanian wiues:
  2120  With bleared visages come forth to view
  2121  The issue of th' exploit: Goe Hercules,
  2122  Liue thou, I liue with much more dismay
  2123  I view the sight, then thou that mak'st the fray.
  2124  
  2125  Here Musicke. A Song the whilst Bassanio comments on the
  2126  Caskets to
  2127  himselfe.
  2128  
  2129  Tell me where is fancie bred,
  2130  Or in the heart, or in the head:
  2131  How begot, how nourished. Replie, replie.
  2132  It is engendred in the eyes,
  2133  With gazing fed, and Fancie dies,
  2134  In the cradle where it lies:
  2135  Let vs all ring Fancies knell.
  2136  Ile begin it.
  2137  Ding, dong, bell
  2138  
  2139     All. Ding, dong, bell
  2140  
  2141     Bass. So may the outward showes be least themselues
  2142  The world is still deceiu'd with ornament.
  2143  In Law, what Plea so tainted and corrupt,
  2144  But being season'd with a gracious voice,
  2145  Obscures the show of euill? In Religion,
  2146  What damned error, but some sober brow
  2147  Will blesse it, and approue it with a text,
  2148  Hiding the grosenesse with faire ornament:
  2149  There is no voice so simple, but assumes
  2150  Some marke of vertue on his outward parts;
  2151  How manie cowards, whose hearts are all as false
  2152  As stayers of sand, weare yet vpon their chins
  2153  The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,
  2154  Who inward searcht, haue lyuers white as milke,
  2155  And these assume but valors excrement,
  2156  To render them redoubted. Looke on beautie,
  2157  And you shall see 'tis purchast by the weight,
  2158  Which therein workes a miracle in nature,
  2159  Making them lightest that weare most of it:
  2160  So are those crisped snakie golden locks
  2161  Which makes such wanton gambols with the winde
  2162  Vpon supposed fairenesse, often knowne
  2163  To be the dowrie of a second head,
  2164  The scull that bred them in the Sepulcher.
  2165  Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
  2166  To a most dangerous sea: the beautious scarfe
  2167  Vailing an Indian beautie; In a word,
  2168  The seeming truth which cunning times put on
  2169  To intrap the wisest. Therefore then thou gaudie gold,
  2170  Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,
  2171  Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
  2172  'Tweene man and man: but thou, thou meager lead
  2173  Which rather threatnest then dost promise ought,
  2174  Thy palenesse moues me more then eloquence,
  2175  And here choose I, ioy be the consequence
  2176  
  2177     Por. How all the other passions fleet to ayre,
  2178  As doubtfull thoughts, and rash imbrac'd despaire:
  2179  And shuddring feare, and greene-eyed iealousie.
  2180  O loue be moderate, allay thy extasie,
  2181  In measure raine thy ioy, scant this excesse,
  2182  I feele too much thy blessing, make it lesse,
  2183  For feare I surfeit
  2184  
  2185     Bas. What finde I here?
  2186  Faire Portias counterfeit. What demie God
  2187  Hath come so neere creation? moue these eies?
  2188  Or whether riding on the bals of mine
  2189  Seeme they in motion? Here are seuer'd lips
  2190  Parted with suger breath, so sweet a barre
  2191  Should sunder such sweet friends: here in her haires
  2192  The Painter plaies the Spider, and hath wouen
  2193  A golden mesh t' intrap the hearts of men
  2194  Faster then gnats in cobwebs: but her eies,
  2195  How could he see to doe them? hauing made one,
  2196  Me thinkes it should haue power to steale both his
  2197  And leaue it selfe vnfurnisht: Yet looke how farre
  2198  The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
  2199  In vnderprising it, so farre this shadow
  2200  Doth limpe behinde the substance. Here's the scroule,
  2201  The continent, and summarie of my fortune.
  2202  You that choose not by the view
  2203  Chance as faire, and choose as true:
  2204  Since this fortune fals to you,
  2205  Be content, and seeke no new.
  2206  If you be well pleasd with this,
  2207  And hold your fortune for your blisse,
  2208  Turne you where your Lady is,
  2209  And claime her with a louing kisse
  2210  
  2211     Bass. A gentle scroule: Faire Lady, by your leaue,
  2212  I come by note to giue, and to receiue,
  2213  Like one of two contending in a prize
  2214  That thinks he hath done well in peoples eies:
  2215  Hearing applause and vniuersall shout,
  2216  Giddie in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
  2217  Whether those peales of praise be his or no.
  2218  So thrice faire Lady stand I euen so,
  2219  As doubtfull whether what I see be true,
  2220  Vntill confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you
  2221  
  2222     Por. You see my Lord Bassiano where I stand,
  2223  Such as I am; though for my selfe alone
  2224  I would not be ambitious in my wish,
  2225  To wish my selfe much better, yet for you,
  2226  I would be trebled twenty times my selfe,
  2227  A thousand times more faire, ten thousand times
  2228  More rich, that onely to stand high in your account,
  2229  I might in vertues, beauties, liuings, friends,
  2230  Exceed account: but the full summe of me
  2231  Is sum of nothing: which to terme in grosse,
  2232  Is an vnlessoned girle, vnschool'd, vnpractiz'd,
  2233  Happy in this, she is not yet so old
  2234  But she may learne: happier then this,
  2235  Shee is not bred so dull but she can learne;
  2236  Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit
  2237  Commits it selfe to yours to be directed,
  2238  As from her Lord, her Gouernour, her King.
  2239  My selfe, and what is mine, to you and yours
  2240  Is now conuerted. But now I was the Lord
  2241  Of this faire mansion, master of my seruants,
  2242  Queene ore my selfe: and euen now, but now,
  2243  This house, these seruants, and this same my selfe
  2244  Are yours, my Lord, I giue them with this ring,
  2245  Which when you part from, loose, or giue away,
  2246  Let it presage the ruine of your loue,
  2247  And be my vantage to exclaime on you
  2248  
  2249     Bass. Maddam, you haue bereft me of all words,
  2250  Onely my bloud speakes to you in my vaines,
  2251  And there is such confusion in my powers,
  2252  As after some oration fairely spoke
  2253  By a beloued Prince, there doth appeare
  2254  Among the buzzing pleased multitude,
  2255  Where euery something being blent together,
  2256  Turnes to a wilde of nothing, saue of ioy
  2257  Exprest, and not exprest: but when this ring
  2258  Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence,
  2259  O then be bold to say Bassanio's dead
  2260  
  2261     Ner. My Lord and Lady, it is now our time
  2262  That haue stood by and seene our wishes prosper,
  2263  To cry good ioy, good ioy my Lord and Lady
  2264  
  2265     Gra. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle Lady,
  2266  I wish you all the ioy that you can wish:
  2267  For I am sure you can wish none from me:
  2268  And when your Honours meane to solemnize
  2269  The bargaine of your faith: I doe beseech you
  2270  Euen at that time I may be married too
  2271  
  2272     Bass. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife
  2273  
  2274     Gra. I thanke your Lordship, you haue got me one.
  2275  My eyes my Lord can looke as swift as yours:
  2276  You saw the mistres, I beheld the maid:
  2277  You lou'd, I lou'd for intermission,
  2278  No more pertaines to me my Lord then you;
  2279  Your fortune stood vpon the caskets there,
  2280  And so did mine too, as the matter falls:
  2281  For wooing heere vntill I swet againe,
  2282  And swearing till my very rough was dry
  2283  With oathes of loue, at last, if promise last,
  2284  I got a promise of this faire one heere
  2285  To haue her loue: prouided that your fortune
  2286  Atchieu'd her mistresse
  2287  
  2288     Por. Is this true Nerrissa?
  2289    Ner. Madam it is so, so you stand pleas'd withall
  2290  
  2291     Bass. And doe you Gratiano meane good faith?
  2292    Gra. Yes faith my Lord
  2293  
  2294     Bass. Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage
  2295  
  2296     Gra. Weele play with them the first boy for a thousand
  2297  ducats
  2298  
  2299     Ner. What and stake downe?
  2300    Gra. No, we shal nere win at that sport, and stake
  2301  downe.
  2302  But who comes heere? Lorenzo and his Infidell?
  2303  What and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
  2304  Enter Lorenzo, Iessica, and Salerio.
  2305  
  2306    Bas. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hether,
  2307  If that the youth of my new interest heere
  2308  Haue power to bid you welcome: by your leaue
  2309  I bid my verie friends and Countrimen
  2310  Sweet Portia welcome
  2311  
  2312     Por. So do I my Lord, they are intirely welcome
  2313  
  2314     Lor. I thanke your honor; for my part my Lord,
  2315  My purpose was not to haue seene you heere,
  2316  But meeting with Salerio by the way,
  2317  He did intreate mee past all saying nay
  2318  To come with him along
  2319  
  2320     Sal. I did my Lord,
  2321  And I haue reason for it, Signior Anthonio
  2322  Commends him to you
  2323  
  2324     Bass. Ere I ope his Letter
  2325  I pray you tell me how my good friend doth
  2326  
  2327     Sal. Not sicke my Lord, vnlesse it be in minde,
  2328  Nor wel, vnlesse in minde: his Letter there
  2329  Wil shew you his estate.
  2330  
  2331  Opens the Letter.
  2332  
  2333    Gra. Nerrissa, cheere yond stranger, bid her welcom.
  2334  Your hand Salerio, what's the newes from Venice?
  2335  How doth that royal Merchant good Anthonio;
  2336  I know he will be glad of our successe,
  2337  We are the Iasons, we haue won the fleece
  2338  
  2339     Sal. I would you had won the fleece that hee hath
  2340  lost
  2341  
  2342     Por. There are some shrewd contents in yond same
  2343  Paper,
  2344  That steales the colour from Bassianos cheeke,
  2345  Some deere friend dead, else nothing in the world
  2346  Could turne so much the constitution
  2347  Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?
  2348  With leaue Bassanio I am halfe your selfe,
  2349  And I must freely haue the halfe of any thing
  2350  That this same paper brings you
  2351  
  2352     Bass. O sweet Portia,
  2353  Heere are a few of the vnpleasant'st words
  2354  That euer blotted paper. Gentle Ladie
  2355  When I did first impart my loue to you,
  2356  I freely told you all the wealth I had
  2357  Ran in my vaines: I was a Gentleman,
  2358  And then I told you true: and yet deere Ladie,
  2359  Rating my selfe at nothing, you shall see
  2360  How much I was a Braggart, when I told you
  2361  My state was nothing, I should then haue told you
  2362  That I was worse then nothing: for indeede
  2363  I haue ingag'd my selfe to a deere friend,
  2364  Ingag'd my friend to his meere enemie
  2365  To feede my meanes. Heere is a Letter Ladie,
  2366  The paper as the bodie of my friend,
  2367  And euerie word in it a gaping wound
  2368  Issuing life blood. But is it true Salerio,
  2369  Hath all his ventures faild, what not one hit,
  2370  From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
  2371  From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,
  2372  And not one vessell scape the dreadfull touch
  2373  Of Merchant-marring rocks?
  2374    Sal. Not one my Lord.
  2375  Besides, it should appeare, that if he had
  2376  The present money to discharge the Iew,
  2377  He would not take it: neuer did I know
  2378  A creature that did beare the shape of man
  2379  So keene and greedy to confound a man.
  2380  He plyes the Duke at morning and at night,
  2381  And doth impeach the freedome of the state
  2382  If they deny him iustice. Twenty Merchants,
  2383  The Duke himselfe, and the Magnificoes
  2384  Of greatest port haue all perswaded with him,
  2385  But none can driue him from the enuious plea
  2386  Of forfeiture, of iustice, and his bond
  2387  
  2388     Iessi. When I was with him, I haue heard him sweare
  2389  To Tuball and to Chus, his Countri-men,
  2390  That he would rather haue Anthonio's flesh,
  2391  Then twenty times the value of the summe
  2392  That he did owe him: and I know my Lord,
  2393  If law, authoritie, and power denie not,
  2394  It will goe hard with poore Anthonio
  2395  
  2396     Por. Is it your deere friend that is thus in trouble?
  2397    Bass. The deerest friend to me, the kindest man,
  2398  The best condition'd, and vnwearied spirit
  2399  In doing curtesies: and one in whom
  2400  The ancient Romane honour more appeares
  2401  Then any that drawes breath in Italie
  2402  
  2403     Por. What summe owes he the Iew?
  2404    Bass. For me three thousand ducats
  2405  
  2406     Por. What, no more?
  2407  Pay him sixe thousand, and deface the bond:
  2408  Double sixe thousand, and then treble that,
  2409  Before a friend of this description
  2410  Shall lose a haire through Bassanio's fault.
  2411  First goe with me to Church, and call me wife,
  2412  And then away to Venice to your friend:
  2413  For neuer shall you lie by Portias side
  2414  With an vnquiet soule. You shall haue gold
  2415  To pay the petty debt twenty times ouer.
  2416  When it is payd, bring your true friend along,
  2417  My maid Nerrissa, and my selfe meane time
  2418  Will liue as maids and widdowes; come away,
  2419  For you shall hence vpon your wedding day:
  2420  Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheere,
  2421  Since you are deere bought, I will loue you deere.
  2422  But let me heare the letter of your friend.
  2423  Sweet Bassanio, my ships haue all miscarried, my Creditors
  2424  grow cruell, my estate is very low, my bond to the Iew is
  2425  forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should liue, all
  2426  debts are cleerd between you and I, if I might see you at my
  2427  death: notwithstanding, vse your pleasure, if your loue doe not
  2428  perswade you to come, let not my letter
  2429  
  2430     Por. O loue! dispach all busines and be gone
  2431  
  2432     Bass. Since I haue your good leaue to goe away,
  2433  I will make hast; but till I come againe,
  2434  No bed shall ere be guilty of my stay,
  2435  Nor rest be interposer twixt vs twaine.
  2436  
  2437  Exeunt.
  2438  
  2439  Enter the Iew, and Solanio, and Anthonio, and the Iaylor.
  2440  
  2441    Iew. Iaylor, looke to him, tell not me of mercy,
  2442  This is the foole that lends out money gratis.
  2443  Iaylor, looke to him
  2444  
  2445     Ant. Heare me yet good Shylok
  2446  
  2447     Iew. Ile haue my bond, speake not against my bond,
  2448  I haue sworne an oath that I will haue my bond:
  2449  Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,
  2450  But since I am a dog, beware my phangs,
  2451  The Duke shall grant me iustice, I do wonder
  2452  Thou naughty Iaylor, that thou art so fond
  2453  To come abroad with him at his request
  2454  
  2455     Ant. I pray thee heare me speake
  2456  
  2457     Iew. Ile haue my bond, I will not heare thee speake,
  2458  Ile haue my bond, and therefore speake no more,
  2459  Ile not be made a soft and dull ey'd foole,
  2460  To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yeeld
  2461  To Christian intercessors: follow not,
  2462  Ile haue no speaking, I will haue my bond.
  2463  
  2464  Exit Iew.
  2465  
  2466    Sol. It is the most impenetrable curre
  2467  That euer kept with men
  2468  
  2469     Ant. Let him alone,
  2470  Ile follow him no more with bootlesse prayers:
  2471  He seekes my life, his reason well I know;
  2472  I oft deliuer'd from his forfeitures
  2473  Many that haue at times made mone to me,
  2474  Therefore he hates me
  2475  
  2476     Sol. I am sure the Duke will neuer grant
  2477  this forfeiture to hold
  2478  
  2479     An. The Duke cannot deny the course of law:
  2480  For the commoditie that strangers haue
  2481  With vs in Venice, if it be denied,
  2482  Will much impeach the iustice of the State,
  2483  Since that the trade and profit of the citty
  2484  Consisteth of all Nations. Therefore goe,
  2485  These greefes and losses haue so bated mee,
  2486  That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
  2487  To morrow, to my bloudy Creditor.
  2488  Well Iaylor, on, pray God Bassanio come
  2489  To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.
  2490  
  2491  Exeunt.
  2492  
  2493  Enter Portia, Nerrissa, Lorenzo, Iessica, and a man of Portias.
  2494  
  2495    Lor. Madam, although I speake it in your presence,
  2496  You haue a noble and a true conceit
  2497  Of god-like amity, which appeares most strongly
  2498  In bearing thus the absence of your Lord.
  2499  But if you knew to whom you shew this honour,
  2500  How true a Gentleman you send releefe,
  2501  How deere a louer of my Lord your husband,
  2502  I know you would be prouder of the worke
  2503  Then customary bounty can enforce you
  2504  
  2505     Por. I neuer did repent for doing good,
  2506  Nor shall not now: for in companions
  2507  That do conuerse and waste the time together,
  2508  Whose soules doe beare an egal yoke of loue.
  2509  There must be needs a like proportion
  2510  Of lyniaments, of manners, and of spirit;
  2511  Which makes me thinke that this Anthonio
  2512  Being the bosome louer of my Lord,
  2513  Must needs be like my Lord. If it be so,
  2514  How little is the cost I haue bestowed
  2515  In purchasing the semblance of my soule;
  2516  From out the state of hellish cruelty,
  2517  This comes too neere the praising of my selfe,
  2518  Therefore no more of it: heere other things
  2519  Lorenso I commit into your hands,
  2520  The husbandry and mannage of my house,
  2521  Vntill my Lords returne; for mine owne part
  2522  I haue toward heauen breath'd a secret vow,
  2523  To liue in prayer and contemplation,
  2524  Onely attended by Nerrissa heere,
  2525  Vntill her husband and my Lords returne:
  2526  There is a monastery too miles off,
  2527  And there we will abide. I doe desire you
  2528  Not to denie this imposition,
  2529  The which my loue and some necessity
  2530  Now layes vpon you
  2531  
  2532     Lorens. Madame, with all my heart,
  2533  I shall obey you in all faire commands
  2534  
  2535     Por. My people doe already know my minde,
  2536  And will acknowledge you and Iessica
  2537  In place of Lord Bassanio and my selfe.
  2538  So far you well till we shall meete againe
  2539  
  2540     Lor. Faire thoughts & happy houres attend on you
  2541  
  2542     Iessi. I wish your Ladiship all hearts content
  2543  
  2544     Por. I thanke you for your wish, and am well pleas'd
  2545  To wish it backe on you: faryouwell Iessica.
  2546  
  2547  Exeunt.
  2548  
  2549  Now Balthaser, as I haue euer found thee honest true,
  2550  So let me finde thee still: take this same letter,
  2551  And vse thou all the indeauor of a man,
  2552  In speed to Mantua, see thou render this
  2553  Into my cosins hand, Doctor Belario,
  2554  And looke what notes and garments he doth giue thee,
  2555  Bring them I pray thee with imagin'd speed
  2556  Vnto the Tranect, to the common Ferrie
  2557  Which trades to Venice; waste no time in words,
  2558  But get thee gone, I shall be there before thee
  2559  
  2560     Balth. Madam, I goe with all conuenient speed
  2561  
  2562     Por. Come on Nerissa, I haue worke in hand
  2563  That you yet know not of; wee'll see our husbands
  2564  Before they thinke of vs?
  2565    Nerrissa. Shall they see vs?
  2566    Portia. They shall Nerrissa: but in such a habit,
  2567  That they shall thinke we are accomplished
  2568  With that we lacke; Ile hold thee any wager
  2569  When we are both accoutered like yong men,
  2570  Ile proue the prettier fellow of the two,
  2571  And weare my dagger with the brauer grace,
  2572  And speake betweene the change of man and boy,
  2573  With a reede voyce, and turne two minsing steps
  2574  Into a manly stride; and speake of frayes
  2575  Like a fine bragging youth: and tell quaint lyes
  2576  How honourable Ladies sought my loue,
  2577  Which I denying, they fell sicke and died.
  2578  I could not doe withall: then Ile repent,
  2579  And wish for all that, that I had not kil'd them;
  2580  And twentie of these punie lies Ile tell,
  2581  That men shall sweare I haue discontinued schoole
  2582  Aboue a twelue moneth: I haue within my minde
  2583  A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Iacks,
  2584  Which I will practise
  2585  
  2586     Nerris. Why, shall wee turne to men?
  2587    Portia. Fie, what a questions that?
  2588  If thou wert nere a lewd interpreter:
  2589  But come, Ile tell thee all my whole deuice
  2590  When I am in my coach, which stayes for vs
  2591  At the Parke gate; and therefore haste away,
  2592  For we must measure twentie miles to day.
  2593  
  2594  Exeunt.
  2595  
  2596  Enter Clowne and Iessica.
  2597  
  2598    Clown. Yes truly; for looke you, the sinnes of the Father
  2599  are to be laid vpon the children, therefore I promise
  2600  you, I feare you, I was alwaies plaine with you, and so
  2601  now I speake my agitation of the matter: therfore be of
  2602  good cheere, for truly I thinke you are damn'd, there is
  2603  but one hope in it that can doe you anie good, and that is
  2604  but a kinde of bastard hope neither
  2605  
  2606     Iessica. And what hope is that I pray thee?
  2607    Clow. Marrie you may partlie hope that your father
  2608  got you not, that you are not the Iewes daughter
  2609  
  2610     Ies. That were a kinde of bastard hope indeed, so the
  2611  sins of my mother should be visited vpon me
  2612  
  2613     Clow. Truly then I feare you are damned both by father
  2614  and mother: thus when I shun Scilla your father, I
  2615  fall into Charibdis your mother; well, you are gone both
  2616  waies
  2617  
  2618     Ies. I shall be sau'd by my husband, he hath made me
  2619  a Christian
  2620  
  2621     Clow. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians
  2622  enow before, e'ne as many as could wel liue one by another:
  2623  this making of Christians will raise the price of
  2624  Hogs, if wee grow all to be porke-eaters, wee shall not
  2625  shortlie haue a rasher on the coales for money.
  2626  Enter Lorenzo.
  2627  
  2628    Ies. Ile tell my husband Lancelet what you say, heere
  2629  he comes
  2630  
  2631     Loren. I shall grow iealous of you shortly Lancelet,
  2632  if you thus get my wife into corners?
  2633    Ies. Nay, you need not feare vs Lorenzo, Launcelet
  2634  and I are out, he tells me flatly there is no mercy for mee
  2635  in heauen, because I am a Iewes daughter: and hee saies
  2636  you are no good member of the common wealth, for
  2637  in conuerting Iewes to Christians, you raise the price
  2638  of Porke
  2639  
  2640     Loren. I shall answere that better to the Commonwealth,
  2641  than you can the getting vp of the Negroes bellie:
  2642  the Moore is with childe by you Launcelet?
  2643    Clow. It is much that the Moore should be more then
  2644  reason: but if she be lesse then an honest woman, shee is
  2645  indeed more then I tooke her for
  2646  
  2647     Loren. How euerie foole can play vpon the word, I
  2648  thinke the best grace of witte will shortly turne into silence,
  2649  and discourse grow commendable in none onely
  2650  but Parrats: goe in sirra, bid them prepare for dinner?
  2651    Clow. That is done sir, they haue all stomacks?
  2652    Loren. Goodly Lord, what a witte-snapper are you,
  2653  then bid them prepare dinner
  2654  
  2655     Clow. That is done to sir, onely couer is the word
  2656  
  2657     Loren. Will you couer than sir?
  2658    Clow. Not so sir neither, I know my dutie
  2659  
  2660     Loren. Yet more quarreling with occasion, wilt thou
  2661  shew the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant; I pray
  2662  thee vnderstand a plaine man in his plaine meaning: goe
  2663  to thy fellowes, bid them couer the table, serue in the
  2664  meat, and we will come in to dinner
  2665  
  2666     Clow. For the table sir, it shall be seru'd in, for the
  2667  meat sir, it shall bee couered, for your comming in to
  2668  dinner sir, why let it be as humors and conceits shall gouerne.
  2669  
  2670  Exit Clowne.
  2671  
  2672    Lor. O deare discretion, how his words are suted,
  2673  The foole hath planted in his memory
  2674  An Armie of good words, and I doe know
  2675  A many fooles that stand in better place,
  2676  Garnisht like him, that for a tricksie word
  2677  Defie the matter: how cheer'st thou Iessica,
  2678  And now good sweet say thy opinion,
  2679  How dost thou like the Lord Bassiano's wife?
  2680    Iessi. Past all expressing, it is very meete
  2681  The Lord Bassanio liue an vpright life
  2682  For hauing such a blessing in his Lady,
  2683  He findes the ioyes of heauen heere on earth,
  2684  And if on earth he doe not meane it, it
  2685  Is reason he should neuer come to heauen?
  2686  Why, if two gods should play some heauenly match,
  2687  And on the wager lay two earthly women,
  2688  And Portia one: there must be something else
  2689  Paund with the other, for the poore rude world
  2690  Hath not her fellow
  2691  
  2692     Loren. Euen such a husband
  2693  Hast thou of me, as she is for a wife
  2694  
  2695     Ies. Nay, but aske my opinion to of that?
  2696    Lor. I will anone, first let vs goe to dinner?
  2697    Ies. Nay, let me praise you while I haue a stomacke?
  2698    Lor. No pray thee, let it serue for table talke,
  2699  Then how som ere thou speakst 'mong other things,
  2700  I shall digest it?
  2701    Iessi. Well, Ile set you forth.
  2702  
  2703  Exeunt.
  2704  
  2705  
  2706  Actus Quartus.
  2707  
  2708  Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Anthonio, Bassanio, and
  2709  Gratiano
  2710  
  2711     Duke. What, is Anthonio heere?
  2712    Ant. Ready, so please your grace?
  2713    Duke. I am sorry for thee, thou art come to answere
  2714  A stonie aduersary, an inhumane wretch,
  2715  Vncapable of pitty, voyd, and empty
  2716  From any dram of mercie
  2717  
  2718     Ant. I haue heard
  2719  Your Grace hath tane great paines to qualifie
  2720  His rigorous course: but since he stands obdurate,
  2721  And that no lawful meanes can carrie me
  2722  Out of his enuies reach, I do oppose
  2723  My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
  2724  To suffer with a quietnesse of spirit,
  2725  The very tiranny and rage of his
  2726  
  2727     Du. Go one and cal the Iew into the Court
  2728  
  2729     Sal. He is ready at the doore, he comes my Lord.
  2730  Enter Shylocke.
  2731  
  2732    Du. Make roome, and let him stand before our face.
  2733  Shylocke the world thinkes, and I thinke so to
  2734  That thou but leadest this fashion of thy mallice
  2735  To the last houre of act, and then 'tis thought
  2736  Thou'lt shew thy mercy and remorse more strange,
  2737  Than is thy strange apparant cruelty;
  2738  And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
  2739  Which is a pound of this poore Merchants flesh,
  2740  Thou wilt not onely loose the forfeiture,
  2741  But touch'd with humane gentlenesse and loue:
  2742  Forgiue a moytie of the principall,
  2743  Glancing an eye of pitty on his losses
  2744  That haue of late so hudled on his backe,
  2745  Enow to presse a royall Merchant downe;
  2746  And plucke commiseration of his state
  2747  From brassie bosomes, and rough hearts of flints,
  2748  From stubborne Turkes and Tarters neuer traind
  2749  To offices of tender curtesie,
  2750  We all expect a gentle answer Iew?
  2751    Iew. I haue possest your grace of what I purpose,
  2752  And by our holy Sabbath haue I sworne
  2753  To haue the due and forfeit of my bond.
  2754  If you denie it, let the danger light
  2755  Vpon your Charter, and your Cities freedome.
  2756  You'l aske me why I rather choose to haue
  2757  A weight of carrion flesh, then to receiue
  2758  Three thousand Ducats? Ile not answer that:
  2759  But say it is my humor; Is it answered?
  2760  What if my house be troubled with a Rat,
  2761  And I be pleas'd to giue ten thousand Ducates
  2762  To haue it bain'd? What, are you answer'd yet?
  2763  Some men there are loue not a gaping Pigge:
  2764  Some that are mad, if they behold a Cat:
  2765  And others, when the bag-pipe sings i'th nose,
  2766  Cannot containe their Vrine for affection.
  2767  Masters of passion swayes it to the moode
  2768  Of what it likes or loaths, now for your answer:
  2769  As there is no firme reason to be rendred
  2770  Why he cannot abide a gaping Pigge?
  2771  Why he a harmlesse necessarie Cat?
  2772  Why he a woollen bag-pipe: but of force
  2773  Must yeeld to such ineuitable shame,
  2774  As to offend himselfe being offended:
  2775  So can I giue no reason, nor I will not,
  2776  More then a lodg'd hate, and a certaine loathing
  2777  I beare Anthonio, that I follow thus
  2778  A loosing suite against him? Are you answered?
  2779    Bass. This is no answer thou vnfeeling man,
  2780  To excuse the currant of thy cruelty
  2781  
  2782     Iew. I am not bound to please thee with my answer
  2783  
  2784     Bass. Do all men kil the things they do not loue?
  2785    Iew. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
  2786    Bass. Euerie offence is not a hate at first
  2787  
  2788     Iew. What wouldst thou haue a Serpent sting thee
  2789  twice?
  2790    Ant. I pray you thinke you question with the Iew:
  2791  You may as well go stand vpon the beach,
  2792  And bid the maine flood baite his vsuall height,
  2793  Or euen as well vse question with the Wolfe,
  2794  The Ewe bleate for the Lambe:
  2795  You may as well forbid the Mountaine Pines
  2796  To wagge their high tops, and to make no noise
  2797  When they are fretted with the gusts of heauen:
  2798  You may as well do any thing most hard,
  2799  As seeke to soften that, then which what harder?
  2800  His Iewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you
  2801  Make no more offers, vse no farther meanes,
  2802  But with all briefe and plaine conueniencie
  2803  Let me haue iudgement, and the Iew his will
  2804  
  2805     Bas. For thy three thousand Ducates heere is six
  2806  
  2807     Iew. If euerie Ducat in sixe thousand Ducates
  2808  Were in sixe parts, and euery part a Ducate,
  2809  I would not draw them, I would haue my bond?
  2810    Du. How shalt thou hope for mercie, rendring none?
  2811    Iew. What iudgement shall I dread doing no wrong?
  2812  You haue among you many a purchast slaue,
  2813  Which like your Asses, and your Dogs and Mules,
  2814  You vse in abiect and in slauish parts,
  2815  Because you bought them. Shall I say to you,
  2816  Let them be free, marrie them to your heires?
  2817  Why sweate they vnder burthens? Let their beds
  2818  Be made as soft as yours: and let their pallats
  2819  Be season'd with such Viands: you will answer
  2820  The slaues are ours. So do I answer you.
  2821  The pound of flesh which I demand of him
  2822  Is deerely bought, 'tis mine, and I will haue it.
  2823  If you deny me; fie vpon your Law,
  2824  There is no force in the decrees of Venice;
  2825  I stand for iudgement, answer, Shall I haue it?
  2826    Du. Vpon my power I may dismisse this Court,
  2827  Vnlesse Bellario a learned Doctor,
  2828  Whom I haue sent for to determine this,
  2829  Come heere to day
  2830  
  2831     Sal. My Lord, heere stayes without
  2832  A Messenger with Letters from the Doctor,
  2833  New come from Padua
  2834  
  2835     Du. Bring vs the Letters, Call the Messengers
  2836  
  2837     Bass. Good cheere Anthonio. What man, corage yet:
  2838  The Iew shall haue my flesh, blood, bones, and all,
  2839  Ere thou shalt loose for me one drop of blood
  2840  
  2841     Ant. I am a tainted Weather of the flocke,
  2842  Meetest for death, the weakest kinde of fruite
  2843  Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me;
  2844  You cannot better be employ'd Bassanio,
  2845  Then to liue still, and write mine Epitaph.
  2846  Enter Nerrissa.
  2847  
  2848    Du. Came you from Padua from Bellario?
  2849    Ner. From both.
  2850  My Lord Bellario greets your Grace
  2851  
  2852     Bas. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
  2853    Iew. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there
  2854  
  2855     Gra. Not on thy soale: but on thy soule harsh Iew
  2856  Thou mak'st thy knife keene: but no mettall can,
  2857  No, not the hangmans Axe beare halfe the keennesse
  2858  Of thy sharpe enuy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
  2859    Iew. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make
  2860  
  2861     Gra. O be thou damn'd, inexecrable dogge,
  2862  And for thy life let iustice be accus'd:
  2863  Thou almost mak'st me wauer in my faith;
  2864  To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
  2865  That soules of Animals infuse themselues
  2866  Into the trunkes of men. Thy currish spirit
  2867  Gouern'd a Wolfe, who hang'd for humane slaughter,
  2868  Euen from the gallowes did his fell soule fleet;
  2869  And whil'st thou layest in thy vnhallowed dam,
  2870  Infus'd it selfe in thee: For thy desires
  2871  Are Woluish, bloody, steru'd, and rauenous
  2872  
  2873     Iew. Till thou canst raile the seale from off my bond
  2874  Thou but offend'st thy Lungs to speake so loud:
  2875  Repaire thy wit good youth, or it will fall
  2876  To endlesse ruine. I stand heere for Law
  2877  
  2878     Du. This Letter from Bellario doth commend
  2879  A yong and Learned Doctor in our Court;
  2880  Where is he?
  2881    Ner. He attendeth heere hard by
  2882  To know your answer, whether you'l admit him
  2883  
  2884     Du. With all my heart. Some three or four of you
  2885  Go giue him curteous conduct to this place,
  2886  Meane time the Court shall heare Bellarioes Letter.
  2887  Your Grace shall vnderstand, that at the receite of your
  2888  Letter I am very sicke: but in the instant that your messenger
  2889  came, in louing visitation, was with me a yong Doctor
  2890  of Rome, his name is Balthasar: I acquainted him with
  2891  the cause in Controuersie, betweene the Iew and Anthonio
  2892  the Merchant: We turn'd ore many Bookes together: hee is
  2893  furnished with my opinion, which bettred with his owne learning,
  2894  the greatnesse whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
  2895  with him at my importunity, to fill vp your Graces request in
  2896  my sted. I beseech you, let his lacke of years be no impediment
  2897  to let him lacke a reuerend estimation: for I neuer knewe so
  2898  yong a body, with so old a head. I leaue him to your gracious
  2899  acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.
  2900  Enter Portia for Balthazar.
  2901  
  2902    Duke. You heare the learn'd Bellario what he writes,
  2903  And heere (I take it) is the Doctor come.
  2904  Giue me your hand: Came you from old Bellario?
  2905    Por. I did my Lord
  2906  
  2907     Du. You are welcome: take your place;
  2908  Are you acquainted with the difference
  2909  That holds this present question in the Court
  2910  
  2911     Por. I am enformed throughly of the cause.
  2912  Which is the Merchant heere? and which the Iew?
  2913    Du. Anthonio and old Shylocke, both stand forth
  2914  
  2915     Por. Is your name Shylocke?
  2916    Iew. Shylocke is my name
  2917  
  2918     Por. Of a strange nature is the sute you follow,
  2919  Yet in such rule, that the Venetian Law
  2920  Cannot impugne you as you do proceed.
  2921  You stand within his danger, do you not?
  2922    Ant. I, so he sayes
  2923  
  2924     Por. Do you confesse the bond?
  2925    Ant. I do
  2926  
  2927     Por. Then must the Iew be mercifull
  2928  
  2929     Iew. On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that
  2930  
  2931     Por. The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
  2932  It droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen
  2933  Vpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,
  2934  It blesseth him that giues, and him that takes,
  2935  'Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes
  2936  The throned Monarch better then his Crowne.
  2937  His Scepter shewes the force of temporall power,
  2938  The attribute to awe and Maiestie,
  2939  Wherein doth sit the dread and feare of Kings:
  2940  But mercy is aboue this sceptred sway,
  2941  It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,
  2942  It is an attribute to God himselfe;
  2943  And earthly power doth then shew likest Gods
  2944  When mercie seasons Iustice. Therefore Iew,
  2945  Though Iustice be thy plea, consider this,
  2946  That in the course of Iustice, none of vs
  2947  Should see saluation: we do pray for mercie,
  2948  And that same prayer, doth teach vs all to render
  2949  The deeds of mercie. I haue spoke thus much
  2950  To mittigate the iustice of thy plea:
  2951  Which if thou follow, this strict course of Venice
  2952  Must needes giue sentence 'gainst the Merchant there
  2953  
  2954     Shy. My deeds vpon my head, I craue the Law,
  2955  The penaltie and forfeite of my bond
  2956  
  2957     Por. Is he not able to discharge the money?
  2958    Bas. Yes, heere I tender it for him in the Court,
  2959  Yea, twice the summe, if that will not suffice,
  2960  I will be bound to pay it ten times ore,
  2961  On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
  2962  If this will not suffice, it must appeare
  2963  That malice beares downe truth. And I beseech you
  2964  Wrest once the Law to your authority.
  2965  To do a great right, do a little wrong,
  2966  And curbe this cruell diuell of his will
  2967  
  2968     Por. It must not be, there is no power in Venice
  2969  Can alter a decree established:
  2970  'Twill be recorded for a President,
  2971  And many an error by the same example,
  2972  Will rush into the state: It cannot be
  2973  
  2974     Iew. A Daniel come to iudgement, yea a Daniel.
  2975  O wise young Iudge, how do I honour thee
  2976  
  2977     Por. I pray you let me looke vpon the bond
  2978  
  2979     Iew. Heere 'tis most reuerend Doctor, heere it is
  2980  
  2981     Por. Shylocke, there's thrice thy monie offered thee
  2982  
  2983     Shy. An oath, an oath, I haue an oath in heauen:
  2984  Shall I lay periurie vpon my soule?
  2985  No not for Venice
  2986  
  2987     Por. Why this bond is forfeit,
  2988  And lawfully by this the Iew may claime
  2989  A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
  2990  Neerest the Merchants heart; be mercifull,
  2991  Take thrice thy money, bid me teare the bond
  2992  
  2993     Iew. When it is paid according to the tenure.
  2994  It doth appeare you are a worthy Iudge:
  2995  You know the Law, your exposition
  2996  Hath beene most sound. I charge you by the Law,
  2997  Whereof you are a well-deseruing pillar,
  2998  Proceede to iudgement: By my soule I sweare,
  2999  There is no power in the tongue of man
  3000  To alter me: I stay heere on my bond
  3001  
  3002     An. Most heartily I do beseech the Court
  3003  To giue the iudgement
  3004  
  3005     Por. Why then thus it is:
  3006  You must prepare your bosome for his knife
  3007  
  3008     Iew. O noble Iudge, O excellent yong man
  3009  
  3010     Por. For the intent and purpose of the Law
  3011  Hath full relation to the penaltie,
  3012  Which heere appeareth due vpon the bond
  3013  
  3014     Iew. 'Tis verie true: O wise and vpright Iudge,
  3015  How much more elder art thou then thy lookes?
  3016    Por. Therefore lay bare your bosome
  3017  
  3018     Iew. I, his brest,
  3019  So sayes the bond, doth it not noble Iudge?
  3020  Neerest his heart, those are the very words
  3021  
  3022     Por. It is so: Are there ballance heere to weigh the
  3023  flesh?
  3024    Iew. I haue them ready
  3025  
  3026     Por. Haue by some Surgeon Shylock on your charge
  3027  To stop his wounds, least he should bleede to death
  3028  
  3029     Iew. It is not nominated in the bond?
  3030    Por. It is not so exprest: but what of that?
  3031  'Twere good you do so much for charitie
  3032  
  3033     Iew. I cannot finde it, 'tis not in the bond
  3034  
  3035     Por. Come Merchant, haue you any thing to say?
  3036    Ant. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
  3037  Giue me your hand Bassanio, fare you well.
  3038  Greeue not that I am falne to this for you:
  3039  For heerein fortune shewes her selfe more kinde
  3040  Then is her custome. It is still her vse
  3041  To let the wretched man out-liue his wealth,
  3042  To view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow
  3043  An age of pouerty. From which lingring penance
  3044  Of such miserie, doth she cut me off:
  3045  Commend me to your honourable Wife,
  3046  Tell her the processe of Anthonio's end:
  3047  Say how I lou'd you; speake me faire in death:
  3048  And when the tale is told, bid her be iudge,
  3049  Whether Bassanio had not once a Loue:
  3050  Repent not you that you shall loose your friend,
  3051  And he repents not that he payes your debt.
  3052  For if the Iew do cut but deepe enough,
  3053  Ile pay it instantly, with all my heart
  3054  
  3055     Bas. Anthonio, I am married to a wife,
  3056  Which is as deere to me as life it selfe,
  3057  But life it selfe, my wife, and all the world,
  3058  Are not with me esteem'd aboue thy life.
  3059  I would loose all, I sacrifice them all
  3060  Heere to this deuill, to deliuer you
  3061  
  3062     Por. Your wife would giue you little thanks for that
  3063  If she were by to heare you make the offer
  3064  
  3065     Gra. I haue a wife whom I protest I loue,
  3066  I would she were in heauen, so she could
  3067  Intreat some power to change this currish Iew
  3068  
  3069     Ner. 'Tis well you offer it behinde her backe,
  3070  The wish would make else an vnquiet house
  3071  
  3072     Iew. These be the Christian husbands: I haue a daughter
  3073  Would any of the stocke of Barrabas
  3074  Had beene her husband, rather then a Christian.
  3075  We trifle time, I pray thee pursue sentence
  3076  
  3077     Por. A pound of that same marchants flesh is thine,
  3078  The Court awards it, and the law doth giue it
  3079  
  3080     Iew. Most rightfull Iudge
  3081  
  3082     Por. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast,
  3083  The Law allowes it, and the Court awards it
  3084  
  3085     Iew. Most learned Iudge, a sentence, come prepare
  3086  
  3087     Por. Tarry a little, there is something else,
  3088  This bond doth giue thee heere no iot of bloud,
  3089  The words expresly are a pound of flesh:
  3090  Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,
  3091  But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
  3092  One drop of Christian bloud, thy lands and goods
  3093  Are by the Lawes of Venice confiscate
  3094  Vnto the state of Venice
  3095  
  3096     Gra. O vpright Iudge,
  3097  Marke Iew, o learned Iudge
  3098  
  3099     Shy. Is that the law?
  3100    Por. Thy selfe shalt see the Act:
  3101  For as thou vrgest iustice, be assur'd
  3102  Thou shalt haue iustice more then thou desirest
  3103  
  3104     Gra. O learned Iudge, mark Iew, a learned Iudge
  3105  
  3106     Iew. I take this offer then, pay the bond thrice,
  3107  And let the Christian goe
  3108  
  3109     Bass. Heere is the money
  3110  
  3111     Por. Soft, the Iew shall haue all iustice, soft, no haste,
  3112  He shall haue nothing but the penalty
  3113  
  3114     Gra. O Iew, an vpright Iudge, a learned Iudge
  3115  
  3116     Por. Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh,
  3117  Shed thou no bloud, nor cut thou lesse nor more
  3118  But iust a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more
  3119  Or lesse then a iust pound, be it so much
  3120  As makes it light or heauy in the substance,
  3121  Or the deuision of the twentieth part
  3122  Of one poore scruple, nay if the scale doe turne
  3123  But in the estimation of a hayre,
  3124  Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate
  3125  
  3126     Gra. A second Daniel, a Daniel Iew,
  3127  Now infidell I haue thee on the hip
  3128  
  3129     Por. Why doth the Iew pause, take thy forfeiture
  3130  
  3131     Shy. Giue me my principall, and let me goe
  3132  
  3133     Bass. I haue it ready for thee, heere it is
  3134  
  3135     Por. He hath refus'd it in the open Court,
  3136  He shall haue meerly iustice and his bond
  3137  
  3138     Gra. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel,
  3139  I thanke thee Iew for teaching me that word
  3140  
  3141     Shy. Shall I not haue barely my principall?
  3142    Por. Thou shalt haue nothing but the forfeiture,
  3143  To be taken so at thy perill Iew
  3144  
  3145     Shy. Why then the Deuill giue him good of it:
  3146  Ile stay no longer question
  3147  
  3148     Por. Tarry Iew,
  3149  The Law hath yet another hold on you.
  3150  It is enacted in the Lawes of Venice,
  3151  If it be proued against an Alien,
  3152  That by direct, or indirect attempts
  3153  He seeke the life of any Citizen,
  3154  The party gainst the which he doth contriue,
  3155  Shall seaze one halfe his goods, the other halfe
  3156  Comes to the priuie coffer of the State,
  3157  And the offenders life lies in the mercy
  3158  Of the Duke onely, gainst all other voice.
  3159  In which predicament I say thou standst:
  3160  For it appeares by manifest proceeding,
  3161  That indirectly, and directly to,
  3162  Thou hast contriu'd against the very life
  3163  Of the defendant: and thou hast incur'd
  3164  The danger formerly by me rehearst.
  3165  Downe therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke
  3166  
  3167     Gra. Beg that thou maist haue leaue to hang thy selfe,
  3168  And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
  3169  Thou hast not left the value of a cord,
  3170  Therefore thou must be hang'd at the states charge
  3171  
  3172     Duk. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
  3173  I pardon thee thy life before thou aske it:
  3174  For halfe thy wealth, it is Anthonio's
  3175  The other halfe comes to the generall state,
  3176  Which humblenesse may driue vnto a fine
  3177  
  3178     Por. I for the state, not for Anthonio
  3179  
  3180     Shy. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that,
  3181  You take my house, when you do take the prop
  3182  That doth sustaine my house: you take my life
  3183  When you doe take the meanes whereby I liue
  3184  
  3185     Por. What mercy can you render him Anthonio?
  3186    Gra. A halter gratis, nothing else for Gods sake
  3187  
  3188     Ant. So please my Lord the Duke, and all the Court
  3189  To quit the fine for one halfe of his goods,
  3190  I am content: so he will let me haue
  3191  The other halfe in vse, to render it
  3192  Vpon his death, vnto the Gentleman
  3193  That lately stole his daughter.
  3194  Two things prouided more, that for this fauour
  3195  He presently become a Christian:
  3196  The other, that he doe record a gift
  3197  Heere in the Court of all he dies possest
  3198  Vnto his sonne Lorenzo, and his daughter
  3199  
  3200     Duk. He shall doe this, or else I doe recant
  3201  The pardon that I late pronounced heere
  3202  
  3203     Por. Art thou contented Iew? what dost thou say?
  3204    Shy. I am content
  3205  
  3206     Por. Clarke, draw a deed of gift
  3207  
  3208     Shy. I pray you giue me leaue to goe from hence,
  3209  I am not well, send the deed after me,
  3210  And I will signe it
  3211  
  3212     Duke. Get thee gone, but doe it
  3213  
  3214     Gra. In christning thou shalt haue two godfathers,
  3215  Had I been iudge, thou shouldst haue had ten more,
  3216  To bring thee to the gallowes, not to the font.
  3217  Enter.
  3218  
  3219    Du. Sir I intreat you with me home to dinner
  3220  
  3221     Por. I humbly doe desire your Grace of pardon,
  3222  I must away this night toward Padua,
  3223  And it is meete I presently set forth
  3224  
  3225     Duk. I am sorry that your leysure serues you not:
  3226  Anthonio, gratifie this gentleman,
  3227  For in my minde you are much bound to him.
  3228  
  3229  Exit Duke and his traine.
  3230  
  3231    Bass. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
  3232  Haue by your wisedome beene this day acquitted
  3233  Of greeuous penalties, in lieu whereof,
  3234  Three thousand Ducats due vnto the Iew
  3235  We freely cope your curteous paines withall
  3236  
  3237     An. And stand indebted ouer and aboue
  3238  In loue and seruice to you euermore
  3239  
  3240     Por. He is well paid that is well satisfied,
  3241  And I deliuering you, am satisfied,
  3242  And therein doe account my selfe well paid,
  3243  My minde was neuer yet more mercinarie.
  3244  I pray you know me when we meete againe,
  3245  I wish you well, and so I take my leaue
  3246  
  3247     Bass. Deare sir, of force I must attempt you further,
  3248  Take some remembrance of vs as a tribute,
  3249  Not as fee: grant me two things, I pray you
  3250  Not to denie me, and to pardon me
  3251  
  3252     Por. You presse mee farre, and therefore I will yeeld,
  3253  Giue me your gloues, Ile weare them for your sake,
  3254  And for your loue Ile take this ring from you,
  3255  Doe not draw backe your hand, ile take no more,
  3256  And you in loue shall not deny me this?
  3257    Bass. This ring good sir, alas it is a trifle,
  3258  I will not shame my selfe to giue you this
  3259  
  3260     Por. I wil haue nothing else but onely this,
  3261  And now methinkes I haue a minde to it
  3262  
  3263     Bas. There's more depends on this then on the valew,
  3264  The dearest ring in Venice will I giue you,
  3265  And finde it out by proclamation,
  3266  Onely for this I pray you pardon me
  3267  
  3268     Por. I see sir you are liberall in offers,
  3269  You taught me first to beg, and now me thinkes
  3270  You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd
  3271  
  3272     Bas. Good sir, this ring was giuen me by my wife,
  3273  And when she put it on, she made me vow
  3274  That I should neither sell, nor giue, nor lose it
  3275  
  3276     Por. That scuse serues many men to saue their gifts,
  3277  And if your wife be not a mad woman,
  3278  And know how well I haue deseru'd this ring,
  3279  Shee would not hold out enemy for euer
  3280  For giuing it to me: well, peace be with you.
  3281  
  3282  Exeunt.
  3283  
  3284    Ant. My L[ord]. Bassanio, let him haue the ring,
  3285  Let his deseruings and my loue withall
  3286  Be valued against your wiues commandement
  3287  
  3288     Bass. Goe Gratiano, run and ouer-take him,
  3289  Giue him the ring, and bring him if thou canst
  3290  Vnto Anthonios house, away, make haste.
  3291  
  3292  Exit Grati.
  3293  
  3294  Come, you and I will thither presently,
  3295  And in the morning early will we both
  3296  Flie toward Belmont, come Anthonio.
  3297  
  3298  Exeunt.
  3299  
  3300  Enter Portia and Nerrissa.
  3301  
  3302    Por. Enquire the Iewes house out, giue him this deed,
  3303  And let him signe it, wee'll away to night,
  3304  And be a day before our husbands home:
  3305  This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
  3306  Enter Gratiano.
  3307  
  3308    Gra. Faire sir, you are well ore-tane:
  3309  My L[ord]. Bassanio vpon more aduice,
  3310  Hath sent you heere this ring, and doth intreat
  3311  Your company at dinner
  3312  
  3313     Por. That cannot be;
  3314  His ring I doe accept most thankfully,
  3315  And so I pray you tell him: furthermore,
  3316  I pray you shew my youth old Shylockes house
  3317  
  3318     Gra. That will I doe
  3319  
  3320     Ner. Sir, I would speake with you:
  3321  Ile see if I can get my husbands ring
  3322  Which I did make him sweare to keepe for euer
  3323  
  3324     Por. Thou maist I warrant, we shal haue old swearing
  3325  That they did giue the rings away to men;
  3326  But weele out-face them, and out-sweare them to:
  3327  Away, make haste, thou know'st where I will tarry
  3328  
  3329     Ner. Come good sir, will you shew me to this house.
  3330  
  3331  Exeunt.

  3335  
  3336  Enter Lorenzo and Iessica.
  3337  
  3338    Lor. The moone shines bright. In such a night as this,
  3339  When the sweet winde did gently kisse the trees,
  3340  And they did make no noyse, in such a night
  3341  Troylus me thinkes mounted the Troian walls,
  3342  And sigh'd his soule toward the Grecian tents
  3343  Where Cressed lay that night
  3344  
  3345     Ies. In such a night
  3346  Did Thisbie fearefully ore-trip the dewe,
  3347  And saw the Lyons shadow ere himselfe,
  3348  And ranne dismayed away
  3349  
  3350     Loren. In such a night
  3351  Stood Dido with a Willow in her hand
  3352  Vpon the wilde sea bankes, and waft her Loue
  3353  To come againe to Carthage
  3354  
  3355     Ies. In such a night
  3356  Medea gathered the inchanted hearbs
  3357  That did renew old Eson
  3358  
  3359     Loren. In such a night
  3360  Did Iessica steale from the wealthy Iewe,
  3361  And with an Vnthrift Loue did runne from Venice,
  3362  As farre as Belmont
  3363  
  3364     Ies. In such a night
  3365  Did young Lorenzo sweare he lou'd her well,
  3366  Stealing her soule with many vowes of faith,
  3367  And nere a true one
  3368  
  3369     Loren. In such a night
  3370  Did pretty Iessica (like a little shrow)
  3371  Slander her Loue, and he forgaue it her
  3372  
  3373     Iessi. I would out-night you did no body come:
  3374  But harke, I heare the footing of a man.
  3375  Enter Messenger.
  3376  
  3377    Lor. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
  3378    Mes. A friend
  3379  
  3380     Loren. A friend, what friend? your name I pray you friend?
  3381    Mes. Stephano is my name, and I bring word
  3382  My Mistresse will before the breake of day
  3383  Be heere at Belmont, she doth stray about
  3384  By holy crosses where she kneeles and prayes
  3385  For happy wedlocke houres
  3386  
  3387     Loren. Who comes with her?
  3388    Mes. None but a holy Hermit and her maid:
  3389  I pray you is my Master yet return'd?
  3390    Loren. He is not, nor we haue not heard from him,
  3391  But goe we in I pray thee Iessica,
  3392  And ceremoniously let vs prepare
  3393  Some welcome for the Mistresse of the house,
  3394  Enter Clowne.
  3395  
  3396    Clo. Sola, sola: wo ha ho, sola, sola
  3397  
  3398     Loren. Who calls?
  3399    Clo. Sola, did you see M[aster]. Lorenzo, & M[aster]. Lorenzo,
  3400  sola,
  3401    Lor. Leaue hollowing man, heere
  3402  
  3403     Clo. Sola, where, where?
  3404    Lor. Heere?
  3405    Clo. Tel him ther's a Post come from my Master, with
  3406  his horne full of good newes, my Master will be here ere
  3407  morning sweete soule
  3408  
  3409     Loren. Let's in, and there expect their comming.
  3410  And yet no matter: why should we goe in?
  3411  My friend Stephen, signifie pray you
  3412  Within the house, your Mistresse is at hand,
  3413  And bring your musique foorth into the ayre.
  3414  How sweet the moone-light sleepes vpon this banke,
  3415  Heere will we sit, and let the sounds of musicke
  3416  Creepe in our eares soft stilnes, and the night
  3417  Become the tutches of sweet harmonie:
  3418  Sit Iessica, looke how the floore of heauen
  3419  Is thicke inlayed with pattens of bright gold,
  3420  There's not the smallest orbe which thou beholdst
  3421  But in his motion like an Angell sings,
  3422  Still quiring to the young eyed Cherubins;
  3423  Such harmonie is in immortall soules,
  3424  But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
  3425  Doth grosly close in it, we cannot heare it:
  3426  Come hoe, and wake Diana with a hymne,
  3427  With sweetest tutches pearce your Mistresse eare,
  3428  And draw her home with musicke
  3429  
  3430     Iessi. I am neuer merry when I heare sweet musique.
  3431  
  3432  Play musicke.
  3433  
  3434    Lor. The reason is, your spirits are attentiue:
  3435  For doe but note a wilde and wanton heard
  3436  Or race of youthful and vnhandled colts,
  3437  Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
  3438  Which is the hot condition of their bloud,
  3439  If they but heare perchance a trumpet sound,
  3440  Or any ayre of musicke touch their eares,
  3441  You shall perceiue them make a mutuall stand,
  3442  Their sauage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze,
  3443  By the sweet power of musicke: therefore the Poet
  3444  Did faine that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods.
  3445  Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
  3446  But musicke for time doth change his nature,
  3447  The man that hath no musicke in himselfe,
  3448  Nor is not moued with concord of sweet sounds,
  3449  Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoyles,
  3450  The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
  3451  And his affections darke as Erobus,
  3452  Let no such man be trusted: marke the musicke.
  3453  Enter Portia and Nerrissa.
  3454  
  3455    Por. That light we see is burning in my hall:
  3456  How farre that little candell throwes his beames,
  3457  So shines a good deed in a naughty world
  3458  
  3459     Ner. When the moone shone we did not see the candle?
  3460    Por. So doth the greater glory dim the lesse,
  3461  A substitute shines brightly as a King
  3462  Vntill a King be by, and then his state
  3463  Empties it selfe, as doth an inland brooke
  3464  Into the maine of waters: musique, harke.
  3465  
  3466  Musicke.
  3467  
  3468    Ner. It is your musicke Madame of the house
  3469  
  3470     Por. Nothing is good I see without respect,
  3471  Methinkes it sounds much sweeter then by day?
  3472    Ner. Silence bestowes that vertue on it Madam
  3473  
  3474     Por. The Crow doth sing as sweetly as the Larke
  3475  When neither is attended: and I thinke
  3476  The Nightingale if she should sing by day
  3477  When euery Goose is cackling, would be thought
  3478  No better a Musitian then the Wren?
  3479  How many things by season, season'd are
  3480  To their right praise, and true perfection:
  3481  Peace, how the Moone sleepes with Endimion,
  3482  And would not be awak'd.
  3483  
  3484  Musicke ceases.
  3485  
  3486    Lor. That is the voice,
  3487  Or I am much deceiu'd of Portia
  3488  
  3489     Por. He knowes me as the blinde man knowes the
  3490  Cuckow by the bad voice?
  3491    Lor. Deere Lady welcome home?
  3492    Por. We haue bene praying for our husbands welfare
  3493  Which speed we hope the better for our words,
  3494  Are they return'd?
  3495    Lor. Madam, they are not yet:
  3496  But there is come a Messenger before
  3497  To signifie their comming
  3498  
  3499     Por. Go in Nerrissa,
  3500  Giue order to my seruants, that they take
  3501  No note at all of our being absent hence,
  3502  Nor you Lorenzo, Iessica nor you.
  3503  
  3504  A Tucket sounds.
  3505  
  3506    Lor. Your husband is at hand, I heare his Trumpet,
  3507  We are no tell-tales Madam, feare you not
  3508  
  3509     Por. This night methinkes is but the daylight sicke,
  3510  It lookes a little paler, 'tis a day,
  3511  Such as the day is, when the Sun is hid.
  3512  Enter Bassanio, Anthonio, Gratiano, and their Followers.
  3513  
  3514    Bas. We should hold day with the Antipodes,
  3515  If you would walke in absence of the sunne
  3516  
  3517     Por. Let me giue light, but let me not be light,
  3518  For a light wife doth make a heauie husband,
  3519  And neuer be Bassanio so for me,
  3520  But God sort all: you are welcome home my Lord
  3521  
  3522     Bass. I thanke you Madam, giue welcom to my friend
  3523  This is the man, this is Anthonio,
  3524  To whom I am so infinitely bound
  3525  
  3526     Por. You should in all sence be much bound to him,
  3527  For as I heare he was much bound for you
  3528  
  3529     Anth. No more then I am wel acquitted of
  3530  
  3531     Por. Sir, you are verie welcome to our house:
  3532  It must appeare in other waies then words,
  3533  Therefore I scant this breathing curtesie
  3534  
  3535     Gra. By yonder Moone I sweare you do me wrong,
  3536  Infaith I gaue it to the Iudges Clearke,
  3537  Would he were gelt that had it for my part,
  3538  Since you do take it Loue so much at hart
  3539  
  3540     Por. A quarrel hoe alreadie, what's the matter?
  3541    Gra. About a hoope of Gold, a paltry Ring
  3542  That she did giue me, whose Poesie was
  3543  For all the world like Cutlers Poetry
  3544  Vpon a knife; Loue mee, and leaue mee not
  3545  
  3546     Ner. What talke you of the Poesie or the valew:
  3547  You swore to me when I did giue it you,
  3548  That you would weare it til the houre of death,
  3549  And that it should lye with you in your graue,
  3550  Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
  3551  You should haue beene respectiue and haue kept it.
  3552  Gaue it a Iudges Clearke: but wel I know
  3553  The Clearke wil nere weare haire on's face that had it
  3554  
  3555     Gra. He wil, and if he liue to be a man
  3556  
  3557     Nerrissa. I, if a Woman liue to be a man
  3558  
  3559     Gra. Now by this hand I gaue it to a youth,
  3560  A kinde of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
  3561  No higher then thy selfe, the Iudges Clearke,
  3562  A prating boy that begg'd it as a Fee,
  3563  I could not for my heart deny it him
  3564  
  3565     Por. You were too blame, I must be plaine with you,
  3566  To part so slightly with your wiues first gift,
  3567  A thing stucke on with oathes vpon your finger,
  3568  And so riueted with faith vnto your flesh.
  3569  I gaue my Loue a Ring, and made him sweare
  3570  Neuer to part with it, and heere he stands:
  3571  I dare be sworne for him, he would not leaue it,
  3572  Nor plucke it from his finger, for the wealth
  3573  That the world masters. Now in faith Gratiano,
  3574  You giue your wife too vnkinde a cause of greefe,
  3575  And 'twere to me I should be mad at it
  3576  
  3577     Bass. Why I were best to cut my left hand off,
  3578  And sweare I lost the Ring defending it
  3579  
  3580     Gra. My Lord Bassanio gaue his Ring away
  3581  Vnto the Iudge that beg'd it, and indeede
  3582  Deseru'd it too: and then the Boy his Clearke
  3583  That tooke some paines in writing, he begg'd mine,
  3584  And neyther man nor master would take ought
  3585  But the two Rings
  3586  
  3587     Por. What Ring gaue you my Lord?
  3588  Not that I hope which you receiu'd of me
  3589  
  3590     Bass. If I could adde a lie vnto a fault,
  3591  I would deny it: but you see my finger
  3592  Hath not the Ring vpon it, it is gone
  3593  
  3594     Por. Euen so voide is your false heart of truth.
  3595  By heauen I wil nere come in your bed
  3596  Vntil I see the Ring
  3597  
  3598     Ner. Nor I in yours, til I againe see mine
  3599  
  3600     Bass. Sweet Portia,
  3601  If you did know to whom I gaue the Ring,
  3602  If you did know for whom I gaue the Ring,
  3603  And would conceiue for what I gaue the Ring,
  3604  And how vnwillingly I left the Ring,
  3605  When nought would be accepted but the Ring,
  3606  You would abate the strength of your displeasure?
  3607    Por. If you had knowne the vertue of the Ring,
  3608  Or halfe her worthinesse that gaue the Ring,
  3609  Or your owne honour to containe the Ring,
  3610  You would not then haue parted with the Ring:
  3611  What man is there so much vnreasonable,
  3612  If you had pleas'd to haue defended it
  3613  With any termes of Zeale: wanted the modestie
  3614  To vrge the thing held as a ceremonie:
  3615  Nerrissa teaches me what to beleeue,
  3616  Ile die for't, but some Woman had the Ring?
  3617    Bass. No by mine honor Madam, by my soule
  3618  No Woman had it, but a ciuill Doctor,
  3619  Which did refuse three thousand Ducates of me,
  3620  And beg'd the Ring; the which I did denie him,
  3621  And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away:
  3622  Euen he that had held vp the verie life
  3623  Of my deere friend. What should I say sweete Lady?
  3624  I was inforc'd to send it after him,
  3625  I was beset with shame and curtesie,
  3626  My honor would not let ingratitude
  3627  So much besmeare it. Pardon me good Lady,
  3628  And by these blessed Candles of the night,
  3629  Had you bene there, I thinke you would haue beg'd
  3630  The Ring of me, to giue the worthie Doctor?
  3631    Por. Let not that Doctor ere come neere my house,
  3632  Since he hath got the iewell that I loued,
  3633  And that which you did sweare to keepe for me,
  3634  I will become as liberall as you,
  3635  Ile not deny him any thing I haue,
  3636  No, not my body, nor my husbands bed:
  3637  Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
  3638  Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argos,
  3639  If you doe not, if I be left alone,
  3640  Now by mine honour which is yet mine owne,
  3641  Ile haue the Doctor for my bedfellow
  3642  
  3643     Nerrissa. And I his Clarke: therefore be well aduis'd
  3644  How you doe leaue me to mine owne protection
  3645  
  3646     Gra. Well, doe you so: let not me take him then,
  3647  For if I doe, ile mar the yong Clarks pen
  3648  
  3649     Ant. I am th' vnhappy subiect of these quarrels
  3650  
  3651     Por. Sir, grieue not you,
  3652  You are welcome notwithstanding
  3653  
  3654     Bas. Portia, forgiue me this enforced wrong,
  3655  And in the hearing of these manie friends
  3656  I sweare to thee, euen by thine owne faire eyes
  3657  Wherein I see my selfe
  3658  
  3659     Por. Marke you but that?
  3660  In both my eyes he doubly sees himselfe:
  3661  In each eye one, sweare by your double selfe,
  3662  And there's an oath of credit
  3663  
  3664     Bas. Nay, but heare me.
  3665  Pardon this fault, and by my soule I sweare
  3666  I neuer more will breake an oath with thee
  3667  
  3668     Anth. I once did lend my bodie for thy wealth,
  3669  Which but for him that had your husbands ring
  3670  Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound againe,
  3671  My soule vpon the forfeit, that your Lord
  3672  Will neuer more breake faith aduisedlie
  3673  
  3674     Por. Then you shall be his suretie: giue him this,
  3675  And bid him keepe it better then the other
  3676  
  3677     Ant. Heere Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring
  3678  
  3679     Bass. By heauen it is the same I gaue the Doctor
  3680  
  3681     Por. I had it of him: pardon Bassanio,
  3682  For by this ring the Doctor lay with me
  3683  
  3684     Ner. And pardon me my gentle Gratiano,
  3685  For that same scrubbed boy the Doctors Clarke
  3686  In liew of this, last night did lye with me
  3687  
  3688     Gra. Why this is like the mending of high waies
  3689  In Sommer, where the waies are faire enough:
  3690  What, are we Cuckolds ere we haue deseru'd it
  3691  
  3692     Por. Speake not so grossely, you are all amaz'd;
  3693  Heere is a letter, reade it at your leysure,
  3694  It comes from Padua from Bellario,
  3695  There you shall finde that Portia was the Doctor,
  3696  Nerrissa there her Clarke. Lorenzo heere
  3697  Shall witnesse I set forth as soone as you,
  3698  And but eu'n now return'd: I haue not yet
  3699  Entred my house. Anthonio you are welcome,
  3700  And I haue better newes in store for you
  3701  Then you expect: vnseale this letter soone,
  3702  There you shall finde three of your Argosies
  3703  Are richly come to harbour sodainlie.
  3704  You shall not know by what strange accident
  3705  I chanced on this letter
  3706  
  3707     Antho. I am dumbe
  3708  
  3709     Bass. Were you the Doctor, and I knew you not?
  3710    Gra. Were you the Clark that is to make me cuckold
  3711  
  3712     Ner. I, but the Clark that neuer meanes to doe it,
  3713  Vnlesse he liue vntill he be a man
  3714  
  3715     Bass. (Sweet Doctor) you shall be my bedfellow,
  3716  When I am absent, then lie with my wife
  3717  
  3718     An. (Sweet Ladie) you haue giuen me life & liuing;
  3719  For heere I reade for certaine that my ships
  3720  Are safelie come to Rode
  3721  
  3722     Por. How now Lorenzo?
  3723  My Clarke hath some good comforts to for you
  3724  
  3725     Ner. I, and Ile giue them him without a fee.
  3726  There doe I giue to you and Iessica
  3727  From the rich Iewe, a speciall deed of gift
  3728  After his death, of all he dies possess'd of
  3729  
  3730     Loren. Faire Ladies you drop Manna in the way
  3731  Of starued people
  3732  
  3733     Por. It is almost morning,
  3734  And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
  3735  Of these euents at full. Let vs goe in,
  3736  And charge vs there vpon intergatories,
  3737  And we will answer all things faithfully
  3738  
  3739     Gra. Let it be so, the first intergatory
  3740  That my Nerrissa shall be sworne on, is,
  3741  Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
  3742  Or goe to bed, now being two houres to day,
  3743  But were the day come, I should wish it darke,
  3744  Till I were couching with the Doctors Clarke.
  3745  Well, while I liue, Ile feare no other thing
  3746  So sore, as keeping safe Nerrissas ring.
  3747  
  3748  Exeunt.
  3749  
  3750  FINIS. The Merchant of Venice.

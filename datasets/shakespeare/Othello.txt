    41  Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
    42  all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
    43  copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
    44  of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
    45  
    46  
    47  We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
    48  of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
    49  
    50  Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
    51  midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
    52  The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
    53  Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
    54  preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
    55  and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
    56  up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
    57  in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
    58  a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
    59  look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
    60  new copy has at least one byte more or less.

    63  Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
    64  
    65  We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
    66  time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
    67  to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
    68  searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
    69  projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
    70  per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
    71  million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
    72  files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
    73  If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
    74  total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
    75  
    76  The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
    77  Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
    78  This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
    79  which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
    80  
    81  At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
    82  of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
    83  manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
    84  from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
    85  assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
    86  more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
    87  don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

   147  Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
   148  They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
   149  your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
   150  someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
   151  fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
   152  disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
   153  you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
   154  
   155  *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
   156  By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
   157  etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
   158  this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
   159  a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
   160  sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
   161  you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
   162  medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
   163  
   164  ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
   165  This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
   166  tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
   167  Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
   168  Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
   169  things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
   170  on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
   171  distribute it in the United States without permission and
   172  without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
   173  below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
   174  under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
   175  
   176  To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
   177  efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
   178  works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
   179  medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
   180  things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
   181  corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
   182  intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
   183  disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
   184  codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
   185  
   186  LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
   187  But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
   188  [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
   189  etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
   190  liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
   191  legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
   192  UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
   193  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   194  OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
   195  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   196  
   197  If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
   198  receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
   199  you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
   200  time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
   201  on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
   202  such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
   203  copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
   204  choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
   205  receive it electronically.
   206  
   207  THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
   208  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS

   210  LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   211  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   212  
   213  Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
   214  the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
   215  above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
   216  may have other legal rights.

   254  
   255       [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
   256            no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

   291  Executive Director's Notes:
   292  
   293  In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
   294  the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
   295  been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
   296  are presented herein:
   297  
   298    Barnardo. Who's there?
   299    Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
   300  your selfe
   301  
   302     Bar. Long liue the King
   303  
   304  ***
   305  
   306  As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
   307  or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
   308  original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
   309  to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
   310  that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
   311  above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
   312  Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .
   313  
   314  The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
   315  time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
   316  place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
   317  as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
   318  more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
   319  
   320  You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
   321  have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
   322  extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
   323  very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
   324  assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
   325  in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
   326  purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
   327  . . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
   328  that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
   329  variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
   330  for signing his name with several different spellings.
   331  
   332  So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
   333  made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
   334  that are "not" errors. . . .
   335  
   336  So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
   337  here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie
   338  of Othello, the Moore of Venice.

   347  
   348  Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
   349  a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
   350  come in ASCII to the printed text.
   351  
   352  The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
   353  conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
   354  punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
   355  printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
   356  together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
   357  Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
   358  spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
   359  abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
   360  brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
   361  you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
   362  purer Shakespeare.
   363  
   364  Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
   365  differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
   366  be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
   367  this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
   368  habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
   369  then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
   370  continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
   371  incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
   372  The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
   373  First Folio editions' best pages.
   374  
   375  If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
   376  errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
   377  free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
   378  etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
   379  and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.

   415  Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose
   416  As Masterly as he. Meere pratle (without practise)
   417  Is all his Souldiership. But he (Sir) had th' election;
   418  And I (of whom his eies had seene the proofe
   419  At Rhodes, at Ciprus, and on others grounds
   420  Christen'd, and Heathen) must be be-leed, and calm'd
   421  By Debitor, and Creditor. This Counter-caster,
   422  He (in good time) must his Lieutenant be,
   423  And I (blesse the marke) his Mooreships Auntient
   424  
   425     Rod. By heauen, I rather would haue bin his hangman
   426  
   427     Iago. Why, there's no remedie.
   428  'Tis the cursse of Seruice;
   429  Preferment goes by Letter, and affection,
   430  And not by old gradation, where each second
   431  Stood Heire to'th' first. Now Sir, be iudge your selfe,
   432  Whether I in any iust terme am Affin'd
   433  To loue the Moore?
   434    Rod. I would not follow him then
   435  
   436     Iago. O Sir content you.
   437  I follow him, to serue my turne vpon him.
   438  We cannot all be Masters, nor all Masters
   439  Cannot be truely follow'd. You shall marke
   440  Many a dutious and knee-crooking knaue;
   441  That (doting on his owne obsequious bondage)
   442  Weares out his time, much like his Masters Asse,
   443  For naught but Prouender, & when he's old Casheer'd.
   444  Whip me such honest knaues. Others there are
   445  Who trym'd in Formes, and visages of Dutie,
   446  Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues,
   447  And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords
   448  Doe well thriue by them.
   449  And when they haue lin'd their Coates
   450  Doe themselues Homage.
   451  These Fellowes haue some soule,
   452  And such a one do I professe my selfe. For (Sir)
   453  It is as sure as you are Rodorigo,
   454  Were I the Moore, I would not be Iago:
   455  In following him, I follow but my selfe.
   456  Heauen is my Iudge, not I for loue and dutie,
   457  But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
   458  For when my outward Action doth demonstrate
   459  The natiue act, and figure of my heart
   460  In Complement externe, 'tis not long after
   461  But I will weare my heart vpon my sleeue
   462  For Dawes to pecke at; I am not what I am
   463  
   464     Rod. What a fall Fortune do's the Thicks-lips owe
   465  If he can carry't thus?
   466    Iago. Call vp her Father:
   467  Rowse him, make after him, poyson his delight,
   468  Proclaime him in the Streets. Incense her kinsmen,
   469  And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell,
   470  Plague him with Flies: though that his Ioy be Ioy,
   471  Yet throw such chances of vexation on't,
   472  As it may loose some colour
   473  
   474     Rodo. Heere is her Fathers house, Ile call aloud
   475  
   476     Iago. Doe, with like timerous accent, and dire yell,
   477  As when (by Night and Negligence) the Fire
   478  Is spied in populus Citties
   479  
   480     Rodo. What hoa: Brabantio, Signior Brabantio, hoa
   481  
   482     Iago. Awake: what hoa, Brabantio: Theeues, Theeues.
   483  Looke to your house, your daughter, and your Bags,
   484  Theeues, Theeues
   485  
   486     Bra. Aboue. What is the reason of this terrible
   487  Summons? What is the matter there?
   488    Rodo. Signior is all your Familie within?
   489    Iago. Are your Doores lock'd?
   490    Bra. Why? Wherefore ask you this?
   491    Iago. Sir, y'are rob'd, for shame put on your Gowne,
   492  Your heart is burst, you haue lost halfe your soule
   493  Euen now, now, very now, an old blacke Ram
   494  Is tupping your white Ewe. Arise, arise,
   495  Awake the snorting Cittizens with the Bell,
   496  Or else the deuill will make a Grand-sire of you.
   497  Arise I say
   498  
   499     Bra. What, haue you lost your wits?
   500    Rod. Most reuerend Signior, do you know my voice?
   501    Bra. Not I: what are you?
   502    Rod. My name is Rodorigo
   503  
   504     Bra. The worsser welcome:
   505  I haue charg'd thee not to haunt about my doores:
   506  In honest plainenesse thou hast heard me say,
   507  My Daughter is not for thee. And now in madnesse
   508  (Being full of Supper, and distempring draughtes)
   509  Vpon malitious knauerie, dost thou come
   510  To start my quiet
   511  
   512     Rod. Sir, Sir, Sir
   513  
   514     Bra. But thou must needs be sure,
   515  My spirits and my place haue in their power
   516  To make this bitter to thee
   517  
   518     Rodo. Patience good Sir
   519  
   520     Bra. What tell'st thou me of Robbing?
   521  This is Venice: my house is not a Grange
   522  
   523     Rodo. Most graue Brabantio,
   524  In simple and pure soule, I come to you
   525  
   526     Ia. Sir: you are one of those that will not serue God,
   527  if the deuill bid you. Because we come to do you seruice,
   528  and you thinke we are Ruffians, you'le haue your Daughter
   529  couer'd with a Barbary horse, you'le haue your Nephewes
   530  neigh to you, you'le haue Coursers for Cozens:
   531  and Gennets for Germaines
   532  
   533     Bra. What prophane wretch art thou?
   534    Ia. I am one Sir, that comes to tell you, your Daughter
   535  and the Moore, are making the Beast with two backs
   536  
   537     Bra. Thou art a Villaine
   538  
   539     Iago. You are a Senator
   540  
   541     Bra. This thou shalt answere. I know thee Rodorigo
   542  
   543     Rod. Sir, I will answere any thing. But I beseech you
   544  If't be your pleasure, and most wise consent,
   545  (As partly I find it is) that your faire Daughter,
   546  At this odde Euen and dull watch o'th' night
   547  Transported with no worse nor better guard,
   548  But with a knaue of common hire, a Gundelier,
   549  To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore:
   550  If this be knowne to you, and your Allowance,
   551  We then haue done you bold, and saucie wrongs.
   552  But if you know not this, my Manners tell me,
   553  We haue your wrong rebuke. Do not beleeue
   554  That from the sence of all Ciuilitie,
   555  I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence.
   556  Your Daughter (if you haue not giuen her leaue)
   557  I say againe, hath made a grosse reuolt,
   558  Tying her Dutie, Beautie, Wit, and Fortunes
   559  In an extrauagant, and wheeling Stranger,
   560  Of here, and euery where: straight satisfie your selfe.
   561  If she be in her Chamber, or your house,
   562  Let loose on me the Iustice of the State
   563  For thus deluding you
   564  
   565     Bra. Strike on the Tinder, hoa:
   566  Giue me a Taper: call vp all my people,
   567  This Accident is not vnlike my dreame,
   568  Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie.
   569  Light, I say, light.
   570  Enter.
   571  
   572    Iag. Farewell: for I must leaue you.
   573  It seemes not meete, nor wholesome to my place
   574  To be producted, (as if I stay, I shall,)
   575  Against the Moore. For I do know the State,
   576  (How euer this may gall him with some checke)
   577  Cannot with safetie cast-him. For he's embark'd
   578  With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres,
   579  (Which euen now stands in Act) that for their soules
   580  Another of his Fadome, they haue none,
   581  To lead their Businesse. In which regard,
   582  Though I do hate him as I do hell paines,
   583  Yet, for necessitie of present life,
   584  I must show out a Flag, and signe of Loue,
   585  (Which is indeed but signe) that you shal surely find him
   586  Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search:
   587  And there will I be with him. So farewell.
   588  
   589  Enter.
   590  
   591  Enter Brabantio, with Seruants and Torches.
   592  
   593    Bra. It is too true an euill. Gone she is,
   594  And what's to come of my despised time,
   595  Is naught but bitternesse. Now Rodorigo,
   596  Where didst thou see her? (Oh vnhappie Girle)
   597  With the Moore saist thou? (Who would be a Father?)
   598  How didst thou know 'twas she? (Oh she deceaues me
   599  Past thought:) what said she to you? Get moe Tapers.
   600  Raise all my Kindred. Are they married thinke you?
   601    Rodo. Truely I thinke they are
   602  
   603     Bra. Oh Heauen: how got she out?
   604  Oh treason of the blood.
   605  Fathers, from hence trust not your Daughters minds
   606  By what you see them act. Is there not Charmes,
   607  By which the propertie of Youth, and Maidhood
   608  May be abus'd? Haue you not read Rodorigo,
   609  Of some such thing?
   610    Rod. Yes Sir: I haue indeed
   611  
   612     Bra. Call vp my Brother: oh would you had had her.
   613  Some one way, some another. Doe you know
   614  Where we may apprehend her, and the Moore?
   615    Rod. I thinke I can discouer him, if you please
   616  To get good Guard, and go along with me
   617  
   618     Bra. Pray you lead on. At euery house Ile call,
   619  (I may command at most) get Weapons (hoa)
   620  And raise some speciall Officers of might:
   621  On good Rodorigo, I will deserue your paines.
   622  
   623  Exeunt.
   624  
   625  
   626  Scena Secunda.
   627  
   628  Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants, with Torches.
   629  
   630    Ia. Though in the trade of Warre I haue slaine men,
   631  Yet do I hold it very stuffe o'th' conscience
   632  To do no contriu'd Murder: I lacke Iniquitie
   633  Sometime to do me seruice. Nine, or ten times
   634  I had thought t'haue yerk'd him here vnder the Ribbes
   635  
   636     Othello. 'Tis better as it is
   637  
   638     Iago. Nay but he prated,
   639  And spoke such scuruy, and prouoking termes
   640  Against your Honor, that with the little godlinesse I haue
   641  I did full hard forbeare him. But I pray you Sir,
   642  Are you fast married? Be assur'd of this,
   643  That the Magnifico is much belou'd,
   644  And hath in his effect a voice potentiall
   645  As double as the Dukes: He will diuorce you.
   646  Or put vpon you, what restraint or greeuance,
   647  The Law (with all his might, to enforce it on)
   648  Will giue him Cable
   649  
   650     Othel. Let him do his spight;
   651  My Seruices, which I haue done the Signorie
   652  Shall out-tongue his Complaints. 'Tis yet to know,
   653  Which when I know, that boasting is an Honour,
   654  I shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being,
   655  From Men of Royall Seige. And my demerites
   656  May speake (vnbonnetted) to as proud a Fortune
   657  As this that I haue reach'd. For know Iago,
   658  But that I loue the gentle Desdemona,
   659  I would not my vnhoused free condition
   660  Put into Circumscription, and Confine,
   661  For the Seas worth. But looke, what Lights come yond?
   662  
   663  Enter Cassio, with Torches.
   664  
   665    Iago. Those are the raised Father, and his Friends:
   666  You were best go in
   667  
   668     Othel. Not I: I must be found.
   669  My Parts, my Title, and my perfect Soule
   670  Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
   671    Iago. By Ianus, I thinke no
   672  
   673     Othel. The Seruants of the Dukes?
   674  And my Lieutenant?
   675  The goodnesse of the Night vpon you (Friends)
   676  What is the Newes?
   677    Cassio. The Duke do's greet you (Generall)
   678  And he requires your haste, Post-haste appearance,
   679  Euen on the instant
   680  
   681     Othello. What is the matter, thinke you?
   682    Cassio. Something from Cyprus, as I may diuine:
   683  It is a businesse of some heate. The Gallies
   684  Haue sent a dozen sequent Messengers
   685  This very night, at one anothers heeles:
   686  And many of the Consuls, rais'd and met,
   687  Are at the Dukes already. You haue bin hotly call'd for,
   688  When being not at your Lodging to be found,
   689  The Senate hath sent about three seuerall Quests,
   690  To search you out
   691  
   692     Othel. 'Tis well I am found by you:
   693  I will but spend a word here in the house,
   694  And goe with you
   695  
   696     Cassio. Aunciant, what makes he heere?
   697    Iago. Faith, he to night hath boarded a Land Carract,
   698  If it proue lawfull prize, he's made for euer
   699  
   700     Cassio. I do not vnderstand
   701  
   702     Iago. He's married
   703  
   704     Cassio. To who?
   705    Iago. Marry to- Come Captaine, will you go?
   706    Othel. Haue with you
   707  
   708     Cassio. Here comes another Troope to seeke for you.
   709  
   710  Enter Brabantio, Rodorigo, with Officers, and Torches.
   711  
   712    Iago. It is Brabantio: Generall be aduis'd,
   713  He comes to bad intent
   714  
   715     Othello. Holla, stand there
   716  
   717     Rodo. Signior, it is the Moore
   718  
   719     Bra. Downe with him, Theefe
   720  
   721     Iago. You, Rodorigo? Come Sir, I am for you
   722  
   723     Othe. Keepe vp your bright Swords, for the dew will
   724  rust them. Good Signior, you shall more command with
   725  yeares, then with your Weapons
   726  
   727     Bra. Oh thou foule Theefe,
   728  Where hast thou stow'd my Daughter?
   729  Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchaunted her
   730  For Ile referre me to all things of sense,
   731  (If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound)
   732  Whether a Maid, so tender, Faire, and Happie,
   733  So opposite to Marriage, that she shun'd
   734  The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation,
   735  Would euer haue (t' encurre a generall mocke)
   736  Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome,
   737  Of such a thing as thou: to feare, not to delight?
   738  Iudge me the world, if 'tis not grosse in sense,
   739  That thou hast practis'd on her with foule Charmes,
   740  Abus'd her delicate Youth, with Drugs or Minerals,
   741  That weakens Motion. Ile haue't disputed on,
   742  'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking;
   743  I therefore apprehend and do attach thee,
   744  For an abuser of the World, a practiser
   745  Of Arts inhibited, and out of warrant;
   746  Lay hold vpon him, if he do resist
   747  Subdue him, at his perill
   748  
   749     Othe. Hold your hands
   750  Both you of my inclining, and the rest.
   751  Were it my Cue to fight, I should haue knowne it
   752  Without a Prompter. Whether will you that I goe
   753  To answere this your charge?
   754    Bra. To Prison, till fit time
   755  Of Law, and course of direct Session
   756  Call thee to answer
   757  
   758     Othe. What if I do obey?
   759  How may the Duke be therewith satisfi'd,
   760  Whose Messengers are heere about my side,
   761  Vpon some present businesse of the State,
   762  To bring me to him
   763  
   764     Officer. 'Tis true most worthy Signior,
   765  The Dukes in Counsell, and your Noble selfe,
   766  I am sure is sent for
   767  
   768     Bra. How? The Duke in Counsell?
   769  In this time of the night? Bring him away;
   770  Mine's not an idle Cause. The Duke himselfe,
   771  Or any of my Brothers of the State,
   772  Cannot but feele this wrong, as 'twere their owne:
   773  For if such Actions may haue passage free,
   774  Bond-slaues, and Pagans shall our Statesmen be.
   775  
   776  Exeunt.
   777  
   778  Scaena Tertia.
   779  
   780  Enter Duke, Senators, and Officers.
   781  
   782    Duke. There's no composition in this Newes,
   783  That giues them Credite
   784  
   785     1.Sen. Indeed, they are disproportioned;
   786  My Letters say, a Hundred and seuen Gallies
   787  
   788     Duke. And mine a Hundred fortie
   789  
   790     2.Sena. And mine two Hundred:
   791  But though they iumpe not on a iust accompt,
   792  (As in these Cases where the ayme reports,
   793  'Tis oft with difference) yet do they all confirme
   794  A Turkish Fleete, and bearing vp to Cyprus
   795  
   796     Duke. Nay, it is possible enough to iudgement:
   797  I do not so secure me in the Error,
   798  But the maine Article I do approue
   799  In fearefull sense
   800  
   801     Saylor within. What hoa, what hoa, what hoa.
   802  
   803  Enter Saylor.
   804  
   805    Officer. A Messenger from the Gallies
   806  
   807     Duke. Now? What's the businesse?
   808    Sailor. The Turkish Preparation makes for Rhodes,
   809  So was I bid report here to the State,
   810  By Signior Angelo
   811  
   812     Duke. How say you by this change?
   813    1.Sen. This cannot be
   814  By no assay of reason. 'Tis a Pageant
   815  To keepe vs in false gaze, when we consider
   816  Th' importancie of Cyprus to the Turke;
   817  And let our selues againe but vnderstand,
   818  That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes,
   819  So may he with more facile question beare it,
   820  For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace,
   821  But altogether lackes th' abilities
   822  That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,
   823  We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull,
   824  To leaue that latest, which concernes him first,
   825  Neglecting an attempt of ease, and gaine
   826  To wake, and wage a danger profitlesse
   827  
   828     Duke. Nay, in all confidence he's not for Rhodes
   829  
   830     Officer. Here is more Newes.
   831  
   832  Enter a Messenger.
   833  
   834    Messen. The Ottamites, Reueren'd, and Gracious,
   835  Steering with due course toward the Ile of Rhodes,
   836  Haue there inioynted them with an after Fleete
   837  
   838     1.Sen. I, so I thought: how many, as you guesse?
   839    Mess. Of thirtie Saile: and now they do re-stem
   840  Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
   841  Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
   842  Your trustie and most Valiant Seruitour,
   843  With his free dutie, recommends you thus,
   844  And prayes you to beleeue him
   845  
   846     Duke. 'Tis certaine then for Cyprus:
   847  Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne?
   848    1.Sen. He's now in Florence
   849  
   850     Duke. Write from vs,
   851  To him, Post, Post-haste, dispatch
   852  
   853     1.Sen. Here comes Brabantio, and the Valiant Moore.
   854  
   855  Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Rodorigo, and Officers.
   856  
   857    Duke. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you,
   858  Against the generall Enemy Ottoman.
   859  I did not see you: welcome gentle Signior,
   860  We lack't your Counsaile, and your helpe to night
   861  
   862     Bra. So did I yours: Good your Grace pardon me.
   863  Neither my place, nor ought I heard of businesse
   864  Hath rais'd me from my bed; nor doth the generall care
   865  Take hold on me. For my perticular griefe
   866  Is of so flood-gate, and ore-bearing Nature,
   867  That it engluts, and swallowes other sorrowes,
   868  And it is still it selfe
   869  
   870     Duke. Why? What's the matter?
   871    Bra. My Daughter: oh my Daughter!
   872    Sen. Dead?
   873    Bra. I, to me.
   874  She is abus'd, stolne from me, and corrupted
   875  By Spels, and Medicines, bought of Mountebanks;
   876  For Nature, so prepostrously to erre,
   877  (Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,)
   878  Sans witch-craft could not
   879  
   880     Duke. Who ere he be, that in this foule proceeding
   881  Hath thus beguil'd your Daughter of her selfe,
   882  And you of her; the bloodie Booke of Law,
   883  You shall your selfe read, in the bitter letter,
   884  After your owne sense: yea, though our proper Son
   885  Stood in your Action
   886  
   887     Bra. Humbly I thanke your Grace,
   888  Here is the man; this Moore, whom now it seemes
   889  Your speciall Mandate, for the State affaires
   890  Hath hither brought
   891  
   892     All. We are verie sorry for't
   893  
   894     Duke. What in your owne part, can you say to this?
   895    Bra. Nothing, but this is so
   896  
   897     Othe. Most Potent, Graue, and Reueren'd Signiors,
   898  My very Noble, and approu'd good Masters;
   899  That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter,
   900  It is most true: true I haue married her;
   901  The verie head, and front of my offending,
   902  Hath this extent; no more. Rude am I, in my speech,
   903  And little bless'd with the soft phrase of Peace;
   904  For since these Armes of mine, had seuen yeares pith,
   905  Till now, some nine Moones wasted, they haue vs'd
   906  Their deerest action, in the Tented Field:
   907  And little of this great world can I speake,
   908  More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles, and Battaile,
   909  And therefore little shall I grace my cause,
   910  In speaking for my selfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience)
   911  I will a round vn-varnish'd Tale deliuer,
   912  Of my whole course of Loue.
   913  What Drugges, what Charmes,
   914  What Coniuration, and what mighty Magicke,
   915  (For such proceeding I am charg'd withall)
   916  I won his Daughter
   917  
   918     Bra. A Maiden, neuer bold:
   919  Of Spirit so still, and quiet, that her Motion
   920  Blush'd at her selfe, and she, in spight of Nature,
   921  Of Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing
   922  To fall in Loue, with what she fear'd to looke on;
   923  It is a iudgement main'd, and most imperfect.
   924  That will confesse Perfection so could erre
   925  Against all rules of Nature, and must be driuen
   926  To find out practises of cunning hell
   927  Why this should be. I therefore vouch againe,
   928  That with some Mixtures, powrefull o're the blood,
   929  Or with some Dram, (coniur'd to this effect)
   930  He wrought vpon her.
   931  To vouch this, is no proofe,
   932  Without more wider, and more ouer Test
   933  Then these thin habits, and poore likely-hoods
   934  Of moderne seeming, do prefer against him
   935  
   936     Sen. But Othello, speake,
   937  Did you, by indirect, and forced courses
   938  Subdue, and poyson this yong Maides affections?
   939  Or came it by request, and such faire question
   940  As soule, to soule affordeth?
   941    Othel. I do beseech you,
   942  Send for the Lady to the Sagitary,
   943  And let her speake of me before her Father;
   944  If you do finde me foule, in her report,
   945  The Trust, the Office, I do hold of you,
   946  Not onely take away, but let your Sentence
   947  Euen fall vpon my life
   948  
   949     Duke. Fetch Desdemona hither
   950  
   951     Othe. Aunciant, conduct them:
   952  You best know the place.
   953  And tell she come, as truely as to heauen,
   954  I do confesse the vices of my blood,
   955  So iustly to your Graue eares, Ile present
   956  How I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue,
   957  And she in mine
   958  
   959     Duke. Say it Othello
   960  
   961     Othe. Her Father lou'd me, oft inuited me:
   962  Still question'd me the Storie of my life,
   963  From yeare to yeare: the Battaile, Sieges, Fortune,
   964  That I haue past.
   965  I ran it through, euen from my boyish daies,
   966  Toth' very moment that he bad me tell it.
   967  Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:
   968  Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field,
   969  Of haire-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;
   970  Of being taken by the Insolent Foe,
   971  And sold to slauery. Of my redemption thence,
   972  And portance in my Trauellours historie.
   973  Wherein of Antars vast, and Desarts idle,
   974  Rough Quarries, Rocks, Hills, whose head touch heauen,
   975  It was my hint to speake. Such was my Processe,
   976  And of the Canibals that each others eate,
   977  The Antropophague, and men whose heads
   978  Grew beneath their shoulders. These things to heare,
   979  Would Desdemona seriously incline:
   980  But still the house Affaires would draw her hence:
   981  Which euer as she could with haste dispatch,
   982  She'l'd come againe, and with a greedie eare
   983  Deuoure vp my discourse. Which I obseruing,
   984  Tooke once a pliant houre, and found good meanes
   985  To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,
   986  That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate,
   987  Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
   988  But not instinctiuely: I did consent,
   989  And often did beguile her of her teares,
   990  When I did speake of some distressefull stroke
   991  That my youth suffer'd: My Storie being done,
   992  She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses:
   993  She swore in faith 'twas strange: 'twas passing strange,
   994  'Twas pittifull: 'twas wondrous pittifull.
   995  She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
   996  That Heauen had made her such a man. She thank'd me,
   997  And bad me, if I had a Friend that lou'd her,
   998  I should but teach him how to tell my Story,
   999  And that would wooe her. Vpon this hint I spake,
  1000  She lou'd me for the dangers I had past,
  1001  And I lou'd her, that she did pitty them.
  1002  This onely is the witch-craft I haue vs'd.
  1003  Here comes the Ladie: Let her witnesse it.
  1004  
  1005  Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.
  1006  
  1007    Duke. I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too,
  1008  Good Brabantio, take vp this mangled matter at the best:
  1009  Men do their broken Weapons rather vse,
  1010  Then their bare hands
  1011  
  1012     Bra. I pray you heare her speake?
  1013  If she confesse that she was halfe the wooer,
  1014  Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
  1015  Light on the man. Come hither gentle Mistris,
  1016  Do you perceiue in all this Noble Companie,
  1017  Where most you owe obedience?
  1018    Des. My Noble Father,
  1019  I do perceiue heere a diuided dutie.
  1020  To you I am bound for life, and education:
  1021  My life and education both do learne me,
  1022  How to respect you. You are the Lord of duty,
  1023  I am hitherto your Daughter. But heere's my Husband;
  1024  And so much dutie, as my Mother shew'd
  1025  To you, preferring you before her Father:
  1026  So much I challenge, that I may professe
  1027  Due to the Moore my Lord
  1028  
  1029     Bra. God be with you: I haue done.
  1030  Please it your Grace, on to the State Affaires;
  1031  I had rather to adopt a Child, then get it.
  1032  Come hither Moore;
  1033  I here do giue thee that with all my heart,
  1034  Which but thou hast already, with all my heart
  1035  I would keepe from thee. For your sake (Iewell)
  1036  I am glad at soule, I haue no other Child,
  1037  For thy escape would teach me Tirranie
  1038  To hang clogges on them. I haue done my Lord
  1039  
  1040     Duke. Let me speake like your selfe:
  1041  And lay a Sentence,
  1042  Which as a grise, or step may helpe these Louers.
  1043  When remedies are past, the griefes are ended
  1044  By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
  1045  To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon,
  1046  Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on.
  1047  What cannot be preseru'd, when Fortune takes:
  1048  Patience, her Iniury a mock'ry makes.
  1049  The rob'd that smiles, steales something from the Thiefe,
  1050  He robs himselfe, that spends a bootelesse griefe
  1051  
  1052     Bra. So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile,
  1053  We loose it not so long as we can smile:
  1054  He beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares,
  1055  But the free comfort which from thence he heares.
  1056  But he beares both the Sentence, and the sorrow,
  1057  That to pay griefe, must of poore Patience borrow.
  1058  These Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall,
  1059  Being strong on both sides, are Equiuocall.
  1060  But words are words, I neuer yet did heare:
  1061  That the bruized heart was pierc'd through the eares.
  1062  I humbly beseech you proceed to th' Affaires of State
  1063  
  1064     Duke. The Turke with a most mighty Preparation
  1065  makes for Cyprus: Othello, the Fortitude of the place is
  1066  best knowne to you. And though we haue there a Substitute
  1067  of most allowed sufficiencie; yet opinion, a more
  1068  soueraigne Mistris of Effects, throwes a more safer
  1069  voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber
  1070  the glosse of your new Fortunes, with this more stubborne,
  1071  and boystrous expedition
  1072  
  1073     Othe. The Tirant Custome, most Graue Senators,
  1074  Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre
  1075  My thrice-driuen bed of Downe. I do agnize
  1076  A Naturall and prompt Alacratie,
  1077  I finde in hardnesse: and do vndertake
  1078  This present Warres against the Ottamites.
  1079  Most humbly therefore bending to your State,
  1080  I craue fit disposition for my Wife,
  1081  Due reference of Place, and Exhibition,
  1082  With such Accomodation and besort
  1083  As leuels with her breeding
  1084  
  1085     Duke. Why at her Fathers?
  1086    Bra. I will not haue it so
  1087  
  1088     Othe. Nor I
  1089  
  1090     Des. Nor would I there recide,
  1091  To put my Father in impatient thoughts
  1092  By being in his eye. Most Gracious Duke,
  1093  To my vnfolding, lend your prosperous eare,
  1094  And let me finde a Charter in your voice
  1095  T' assist my simplenesse
  1096  
  1097     Duke. What would you Desdemona?
  1098    Des. That I loue the Moore, to liue with him,
  1099  My downe-right violence, and storme of Fortunes,
  1100  May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdu'd
  1101  Euen to the very quality of my Lord;
  1102  I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
  1103  And to his Honours and his valiant parts,
  1104  Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate.
  1105  So that (deere Lords) if I be left behind
  1106  A Moth of Peace, and he go to the Warre,
  1107  The Rites for why I loue him, are bereft me:
  1108  And I a heauie interim shall support
  1109  By his deere absence. Let me go with him
  1110  
  1111     Othe. Let her haue your voice.
  1112  Vouch with me Heauen, I therefore beg it not
  1113  To please the pallate of my Appetite:
  1114  Nor to comply with heat the yong affects
  1115  In my defunct, and proper satisfaction.
  1116  But to be free, and bounteous to her minde:
  1117  And Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke
  1118  I will your serious and great businesse scant
  1119  When she is with me. No, when light wing'd Toyes
  1120  Of feather'd Cupid, seele with wanton dulnesse
  1121  My speculatiue, and offic'd Instrument:
  1122  That my Disports corrupt, and taint my businesse:
  1123  Let House-wiues make a Skillet of my Helme,
  1124  And all indigne, and base aduersities,
  1125  Make head against my Estimation
  1126  
  1127     Duke. Be it as you shall priuately determine,
  1128  Either for her stay, or going: th' Affaire cries hast:
  1129  And speed must answer it
  1130  
  1131     Sen. You must away to night
  1132  
  1133     Othe. With all my heart
  1134  
  1135     Duke. At nine i'th' morning, here wee'l meete againe.
  1136  Othello, leaue some Officer behind
  1137  And he shall our Commission bring to you:
  1138  And such things else of qualitie and respect
  1139  As doth import you
  1140  
  1141     Othe. So please your Grace, my Ancient,
  1142  A man he is of honesty and trust:
  1143  To his conueyance I assigne my wife,
  1144  With what else needfull, your good Grace shall think
  1145  To be sent after me
  1146  
  1147     Duke. Let it be so:
  1148  Good night to euery one. And Noble Signior,
  1149  If Vertue no delighted Beautie lacke,
  1150  Your Son-in-law is farre more Faire then Blacke
  1151  
  1152     Sen. Adieu braue Moore, vse Desdemona well
  1153  
  1154     Bra. Looke to her (Moore) if thou hast eies to see:
  1155  She ha's deceiu'd her Father, and may thee.
  1156  Enter.
  1157  
  1158    Othe. My life vpon her faith. Honest Iago,
  1159  My Desdemona must I leaue to thee:
  1160  I prythee let thy wife attend on her,
  1161  And bring them after in the best aduantage.
  1162  Come Desdemona, I haue but an houre
  1163  Of Loue, of wordly matter, and direction
  1164  To spend with thee. We must obey the time.
  1165  Enter.
  1166  
  1167    Rod. Iago
  1168  
  1169     Iago. What saist thou Noble heart?
  1170    Rod. What will I do, think'st thou?
  1171    Iago. Why go to bed and sleepe
  1172  
  1173     Rod. I will incontinently drowne my selfe
  1174  
  1175     Iago. If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why
  1176  thou silly Gentleman?
  1177    Rod. It is sillynesse to liue, when to liue is torment:
  1178  and then haue we a prescription to dye, when death is
  1179  our Physition
  1180  
  1181     Iago. Oh villanous: I haue look'd vpon the world
  1182  for foure times seuen yeares, and since I could distinguish
  1183  betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that
  1184  knew how to loue himselfe. Ere I would say, I would
  1185  drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would
  1186  change my Humanity with a Baboone
  1187  
  1188     Rod. What should I do? I confesse it is my shame
  1189  to be so fond, but it is not in my vertue to amend it
  1190  
  1191     Iago. Vertue? A figge, 'tis in our selues that we are
  1192  thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,
  1193  our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Nettels,
  1194  or sowe Lettice: Set Hisope, and weede vp Time:
  1195  Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or distract it with
  1196  many: either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse, or manured
  1197  with Industry, why the power, and Corrigeable authoritie
  1198  of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues
  1199  had not one Scale of Reason, to poize another of Sensualitie,
  1200  the blood, and basenesse of our Natures would
  1201  conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions. But we
  1202  haue Reason to coole our raging Motions, our carnall
  1203  Stings, or vnbitted Lusts: whereof I take this, that you
  1204  call Loue, to be a Sect, or Seyen
  1205  
  1206     Rod. It cannot be
  1207  
  1208     Iago. It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission
  1209  of the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy selfe? Drown
  1210  Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profest me thy Friend,
  1211  and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing, with Cables of
  1212  perdurable toughnesse. I could neuer better steed thee
  1213  then now. Put Money in thy purse: follow thou the
  1214  Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an vsurp'd Beard. I say
  1215  put Money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona
  1216  should continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in
  1217  thy purse: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commencement
  1218  in her, and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration,
  1219  put but Money in thy purse. These Moores
  1220  are changeable in their wils: fill thy purse with Money.
  1221  The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts,
  1222  shalbe to him shortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She
  1223  must change for youth: when she is sated with his body
  1224  she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Money
  1225  in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe, do
  1226  it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Money
  1227  thou canst: If Sanctimonie, and a fraile vow, betwixt
  1228  an erring Barbarian, and super-subtle Venetian be
  1229  not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou
  1230  shalt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drowning
  1231  thy selfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou rather
  1232  to be hang'd in Compassing thy ioy, then to be
  1233  drown'd, and go without her
  1234  
  1235     Rodo. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
  1236  the issue?
  1237    Iago. Thou art sure of me: Go make Money: I haue
  1238  told thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I
  1239  hate the Moore. My cause is hearted; thine hath no lesse
  1240  reason. Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge, against
  1241  him. If thou canst Cuckold him, thou dost thy selfe a
  1242  pleasure, me a sport. There are many Euents in the
  1243  Wombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauerse, go,
  1244  prouide thy Money. We will haue more of this to morrow.
  1245  Adieu
  1246  
  1247     Rod. Where shall we meete i'th' morning?
  1248    Iago. At my Lodging
  1249  
  1250     Rod. Ile be with thee betimes
  1251  
  1252     Iago. Go too, farewell. Do you heare Rodorigo?
  1253    Rod. Ile sell all my Land.
  1254  Enter.
  1255  
  1256    Iago. Thus do I euer make my Foole, my purse:
  1257  For I mine owne gain'd knowledge should prophane
  1258  If I would time expend with such Snipe,
  1259  But for my Sport, and Profit: I hate the Moore,
  1260  And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
  1261  She ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true,
  1262  But I, for meere suspition in that kinde,
  1263  Will do, as if for Surety. He holds me well,
  1264  The better shall my purpose worke on him:
  1265  Cassio's a proper man: Let me see now,
  1266  To get his Place, and to plume vp my will
  1267  In double Knauery. How? How? Let's see.
  1268  After some time, to abuse Othello's eares,
  1269  That he is too familiar with his wife:
  1270  He hath a person, and a smooth dispose
  1271  To be suspected: fram'd to make women false.
  1272  The Moore is of a free, and open Nature,
  1273  That thinkes men honest, that but seeme to be so,
  1274  And will as tenderly be lead by'th' Nose
  1275  As Asses are:
  1276  I hau't: it is engendred: Hell, and Night,
  1277  Must bring this monstrous Birth, to the worlds light.
  1278  
  1279  Actus Secundus. Scena Prima.
  1280  
  1281  Enter Montano, and two Gentlemen.
  1282  
  1283    Mon. What from the Cape, can you discerne at Sea?
  1284    1.Gent. Nothing at all, it is a high wrought Flood:
  1285  I cannot 'twixt the Heauen, and the Maine,
  1286  Descry a Saile
  1287  
  1288     Mon. Me thinks, the wind hath spoke aloud at Land,
  1289  A fuller blast ne're shooke our Battlements:
  1290  If it hath ruffiand so vpon the Sea,
  1291  What ribbes of Oake, when Mountaines melt on them,
  1292  Can hold the Morties. What shall we heare of this?
  1293    2 A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet:
  1294  For do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore,
  1295  The chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds,
  1296  The winde-shak'd-Surge, with high & monstrous Maine
  1297  Seemes to cast water on the burning Beare,
  1298  And quench the Guards of th' euer-fixed Pole:
  1299  I neuer did like mollestation view
  1300  On the enchafed Flood
  1301  
  1302     Men. If that the Turkish Fleete
  1303  Be not enshelter'd, and embay'd, they are drown'd,
  1304  It is impossible to beare it out.
  1305  Enter a Gentleman.
  1306  
  1307    3 Newes Laddes: our warres are done:
  1308  The desperate Tempest hath so bang'd the Turkes,
  1309  That their designement halts. A Noble ship of Venice,
  1310  Hath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance
  1311  On most part of their Fleet
  1312  
  1313     Mon. How? Is this true?
  1314    3 The Ship is heere put in: A Verennessa, Michael Cassio
  1315  Lieutenant to the warlike Moore, Othello,
  1316  Is come on Shore: the Moore himselfe at Sea,
  1317  And is in full Commission heere for Cyprus
  1318  
  1319     Mon. I am glad on't:
  1320  'Tis a worthy Gouernour
  1321  
  1322     3 But this same Cassio, though he speake of comfort,
  1323  Touching the Turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly,
  1324  And praye the Moore be safe; for they were parted
  1325  With fowle and violent Tempest
  1326  
  1327     Mon. Pray Heauens he be:
  1328  For I haue seru'd him, and the man commands
  1329  Like a full Soldier. Let's to the Sea-side (hoa)
  1330  As well to see the Vessell that's come in,
  1331  As to throw-out our eyes for braue Othello,
  1332  Euen till we make the Maine, and th' Eriall blew,
  1333  An indistinct regard
  1334  
  1335     Gent. Come, let's do so;
  1336  For euery Minute is expectancie
  1337  Of more Arriuancie.
  1338  Enter Cassio.
  1339  
  1340    Cassi. Thankes you, the valiant of the warlike Isle,
  1341  That so approoue the Moore: Oh let the Heauens
  1342  Giue him defence against the Elements,
  1343  For I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea
  1344  
  1345     Mon. Is he well ship'd?
  1346    Cassio. His Barke is stoutly Timber'd, and his Pylot
  1347  Of verie expert, and approu'd Allowance;
  1348  Therefore my hope's (not surfetted to death)
  1349  Stand in bold Cure
  1350  
  1351     Within. A Saile, a Saile, a Saile
  1352  
  1353     Cassio. What noise?
  1354    Gent. The Towne is empty; on the brow o'th' Sea
  1355  Stand rankes of People and they cry, a Saile
  1356  
  1357     Cassio. My hopes do shape him for the Gouernor
  1358  
  1359     Gent. They do discharge their Shot of Courtesie,
  1360  Our Friends, at least
  1361  
  1362     Cassio. I pray you Sir, go forth,
  1363  And giue vs truth who 'tis that is arriu'd
  1364  
  1365     Gent. I shall.
  1366  Enter.
  1367  
  1368    Mon. But good Lieutenant, is your Generall wiu'd?
  1369    Cassio. Most fortunately: he hath atchieu'd a Maid
  1370  That paragons description, and wilde Fame:
  1371  One that excels the quirkes of Blazoning pens,
  1372  And in th' essentiall Vesture of Creation,
  1373  Do's tyre the Ingeniuer.
  1374  Enter Gentleman.
  1375  
  1376  How now? Who ha's put in?
  1377    Gent. 'Tis one Iago, Auncient to the Generall
  1378  
  1379     Cassio. Ha's had most fauourable, and happie speed:
  1380  Tempests themselues, high Seas, and howling windes,
  1381  The gutter'd-Rockes, and Congregated Sands,
  1382  Traitors ensteep'd, to enclogge the guiltlesse Keele,
  1383  As hauing sence of Beautie, do omit
  1384  Their mortall Natures, letting go safely by
  1385  The Diuine Desdemona
  1386  
  1387     Mon. What is she?
  1388    Cassio. She that I spake of:
  1389  Our great Captains Captaine,
  1390  Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
  1391  Whose footing heere anticipates our thoughts,
  1392  A Senights speed. Great Ioue, Othello guard,
  1393  And swell his Saile with thine owne powrefull breath,
  1394  That he may blesse this Bay with his tall Ship,
  1395  Make loues quicke pants in Desdemonaes Armes,
  1396  Giue renew'd fire to our extincted Spirits.
  1397  
  1398  Enter Desdemona, Iago, Rodorigo, and Aemilia.
  1399  
  1400  Oh behold,
  1401  The Riches of the Ship is come on shore:
  1402  You men of Cyprus, let her haue your knees.
  1403  Haile to thee Ladie: and the grace of Heauen,
  1404  Before, behinde thee, and on euery hand
  1405  Enwheele thee round
  1406  
  1407     Des. I thanke you, Valiant Cassio,
  1408  What tydings can you tell of my Lord?
  1409    Cas. He is not yet arriu'd, nor know I ought
  1410  But that he's well, and will be shortly heere
  1411  
  1412     Des. Oh, but I feare:
  1413  How lost you company?
  1414    Cassio. The great Contention of Sea, and Skies
  1415  Parted our fellowship. But hearke, a Saile
  1416  
  1417     Within. A Saile, a Saile
  1418  
  1419     Gent. They giue this greeting to the Cittadell:
  1420  This likewise is a Friend
  1421  
  1422     Cassio. See for the Newes:
  1423  Good Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome Mistris:
  1424  Let it not gaule your patience (good Iago)
  1425  That I extend my Manners. 'Tis my breeding,
  1426  That giues me this bold shew of Curtesie
  1427  
  1428     Iago. Sir, would she giue you so much of her lippes,
  1429  As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me,
  1430  You would haue enough
  1431  
  1432     Des. Alas: she ha's no speech
  1433  
  1434     Iago. Infaith too much:
  1435  I finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe.
  1436  Marry before your Ladyship, I grant,
  1437  She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
  1438  And chides with thinking
  1439  
  1440     aemil. You haue little cause to say so
  1441  
  1442     Iago. Come on, come on: you are Pictures out of
  1443  doore: Bells in your Parlours: Wilde-Cats in your Kitchens:
  1444  Saints in your Iniuries: Diuels being offended:
  1445  Players in your Huswiferie, and Huswiues in your
  1446  Beds
  1447  
  1448     Des. Oh, fie vpon thee, Slanderer
  1449  
  1450     Iago. Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke,
  1451  You rise to play, and go to bed to worke.
  1452  Aemil. You shall not write my praise
  1453  
  1454     Iago. No, let me not
  1455  
  1456     Desde. What would'st write of me, if thou should'st
  1457  praise me?
  1458    Iago. Oh, gentle Lady, do not put me too't,
  1459  For I am nothing, if not Criticall
  1460  
  1461     Des. Come on, assay.
  1462  There's one gone to the Harbour?
  1463    Iago. I Madam
  1464  
  1465     Des. I am not merry: but I do beguile
  1466  The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
  1467  Come, how would'st thou praise me?
  1468    Iago. I am about it, but indeed my inuention comes
  1469  from my pate, as Birdlyme do's from Freeze, it pluckes
  1470  out Braines and all. But my Muse labours, and thus she
  1471  is deliuer'd.
  1472  If she be faire, and wise: fairenesse, and wit,
  1473  The ones for vse, the other vseth it
  1474  
  1475     Des. Well prais'd:
  1476  How if she be Blacke and Witty?
  1477    Iago. If she be blacke, and thereto haue a wit,
  1478  She'le find a white, that shall her blacknesse fit
  1479  
  1480     Des. Worse, and worse.
  1481  Aemil. How if Faire, and Foolish?
  1482    Iago. She neuer yet was foolish that was faire,
  1483  For euen her folly helpt her to an heire
  1484  
  1485     Desde. These are old fond Paradoxes, to make Fooles
  1486  laugh i'th' Alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou
  1487  for her that's Foule, and Foolish
  1488  
  1489     Iago. There's none so foule and foolish thereunto,
  1490  But do's foule pranks, which faire, and wise-ones do
  1491  
  1492     Desde. Oh heauy ignorance: thou praisest the worst
  1493  best. But what praise could'st thou bestow on a deseruing
  1494  woman indeed? One, that in the authorithy of her
  1495  merit, did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it
  1496  selfe
  1497  
  1498     Iago. She that was euer faire, and neuer proud,
  1499  Had Tongue at will, and yet was neuer loud:
  1500  Neuer lackt Gold, and yet went neuer gay,
  1501  Fled from her wish, and yet said now I may.
  1502  She that being angred, her reuenge being nie,
  1503  Bad her wrong stay, and her displeasure flie:
  1504  She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile,
  1505  To change the Cods-head for the Salmons taile:
  1506  She that could thinke, and neu'r disclose her mind,
  1507  See Suitors following, and not looke behind:
  1508  She was a wight, (if euer such wightes were)
  1509    Des. To do what?
  1510    Iago. To suckle Fooles, and chronicle small Beere
  1511  
  1512     Desde. Oh most lame and impotent conclusion. Do
  1513  not learne of him aemillia, though he be thy husband.
  1514  How say you (Cassio) is he not a most prophane, and liberall
  1515  Counsailor?
  1516    Cassio. He speakes home (Madam) you may rellish
  1517  him more in the Souldier, then in the Scholler
  1518  
  1519     Iago. He takes her by the palme: I, well said, whisper.
  1520  With as little a web as this, will I ensnare as great
  1521  a Fly as Cassio. I smile vpon her, do: I will giue thee
  1522  in thine owne Courtship. You say true, 'tis so indeed.
  1523  If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie,
  1524  it had beene better you had not kiss'd your three fingers
  1525  so oft, which now againe you are most apt to play
  1526  the Sir, in. Very good: well kiss'd, and excellent Curtsie:
  1527  'tis so indeed. Yet againe, your fingers to your
  1528  lippes? Would they were Cluster-pipes for your
  1529  sake.
  1530  The Moore I know his Trumpet
  1531  
  1532     Cassio. 'Tis truely so
  1533  
  1534     Des. Let's meete him, and recieue him
  1535  
  1536     Cassio. Loe, where he comes.
  1537  Enter Othello, and Attendants.
  1538  
  1539    Oth. O, my faire Warriour
  1540  
  1541     Des. My deere Othello
  1542  
  1543     Othe. It giues me wonder great, as my content
  1544  To see you heere before me.
  1545  Oh my Soules Ioy:
  1546  If after euery Tempest, come such Calmes,
  1547  May the windes blow, till they haue waken'd death:
  1548  And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas
  1549  Olympus high: and duck againe as low,
  1550  As hell's from Heauen. If it were now to dye,
  1551  'Twere now to be most happy. For I feare,
  1552  My Soule hath her content so absolute,
  1553  That not another comfort like to this,
  1554  Succeedes in vnknowne Fate
  1555  
  1556     Des. The Heauens forbid
  1557  But that our Loues
  1558  And Comforts should encrease
  1559  Euen as our dayes do grow
  1560  
  1561     Othe. Amen to that (sweet Powers)
  1562  I cannot speake enough of this content,
  1563  It stoppes me heere: it is too much of ioy.
  1564  And this, and this the greatest discords be
  1565  That ere our hearts shall make
  1566  
  1567     Iago. Oh you are well tun'd now: But Ile set downe
  1568  the peggs that make this Musicke, as honest as I am
  1569  
  1570     Othe. Come: let vs to the Castle.
  1571  Newes (Friends) our Warres are done:
  1572  The Turkes are drown'd.
  1573  How do's my old Acquaintance of this Isle?
  1574  (Hony) you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus,
  1575  I haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet,
  1576  I prattle out of fashion, and I doate
  1577  In mine owne comforts. I prythee, good Iago,
  1578  Go to the Bay, and disimbarke my Coffers:
  1579  Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell,
  1580  He is a good one, and his worthynesse
  1581  Do's challenge much respect. Come Desdemona,
  1582  Once more well met at Cyprus.
  1583  
  1584  Exit Othello and Desdemona.
  1585  
  1586    Iago. Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour.
  1587  Come thither, if thou be'st Valiant, (as they say base men
  1588  being in Loue, haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures,
  1589  more then is natiue to them) list-me; the Lieutenant to
  1590  night watches on the Court of Guard. First, I must tell
  1591  thee this: Desdemona, is directly in loue with him
  1592  
  1593     Rod. With him? Why, 'tis not possible
  1594  
  1595     Iago. Lay thy finger thus: and let thy soule be instructed.
  1596  Marke me with what violence she first lou'd
  1597  the Moore, but for bragging, and telling her fantasticall
  1598  lies. To loue him still for prating, let not thy discreet
  1599  heart thinke it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight
  1600  shall she haue to looke on the diuell? When the Blood
  1601  is made dull with the Act of Sport, there should be a
  1602  game to enflame it, and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite.
  1603  Louelinesse in fauour, simpathy in yeares, Manners,
  1604  and Beauties: all which the Moore is defectiue in. Now
  1605  for want of these requir'd Conueniences, her delicate
  1606  tendernesse wil finde it selfe abus'd, begin to heaue the,
  1607  gorge, disrellish and abhorre the Moore, very Nature wil
  1608  instruct her in it, and compell her to some second choice.
  1609  Now Sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and vnforc'd
  1610  position) who stands so eminent in the degree of
  1611  this Fortune, as Cassio do's: a knaue very voluble: no
  1612  further conscionable, then in putting on the meere forme
  1613  of Ciuill, and Humaine seeming, for the better compasse
  1614  of his salt, and most hidden loose Affection? Why none,
  1615  why none: A slipper, and subtle knaue, a finder of occasion:
  1616  that he's an eye can stampe, and counterfeit Aduantages,
  1617  though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe.
  1618  A diuelish knaue: besides, the knaue is handsome, young:
  1619  and hath all those requisites in him, that folly and greene
  1620  mindes looke after. A pestilent compleat knaue, and the
  1621  woman hath found him already
  1622  
  1623     Rodo. I cannot beleeue that in her, she's full of most
  1624  bless'd condition
  1625  
  1626     Iago. Bless'd figges-end. The Wine she drinkes is
  1627  made of grapes. If shee had beene bless'd, shee would
  1628  neuer haue lou'd the Moore: Bless'd pudding. Didst thou
  1629  not see her paddle with the palme of his hand? Didst not
  1630  marke that?
  1631    Rod. Yes, that I did: but that was but curtesie
  1632  
  1633     Iago . Leacherie by this hand: an Index, and obscure
  1634  prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts.
  1635  They met so neere with their lippes, that their breathes
  1636  embrac'd together. Villanous thoughts Rodorigo, when
  1637  these mutabilities so marshall the way, hard at hand
  1638  comes the Master, and maine exercise, th' incorporate
  1639  conclusion: Pish. But Sir, be you rul'd by me. I haue
  1640  brought you from Venice. Watch you to night: for
  1641  the Command, Ile lay't vpon you. Cassio knowes you
  1642  not: Ile not be farre from you. Do you finde some occasion
  1643  to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or
  1644  tainting his discipline, or from what other course
  1645  you please, which the time shall more fauorably minister
  1646  
  1647     Rod. Well
  1648  
  1649     Iago. Sir, he's rash, and very sodaine in Choller: and
  1650  happely may strike at you, prouoke him that he may: for
  1651  euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny.
  1652  Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe,
  1653  but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you
  1654  haue a shorter iourney to your desires, by the meanes I
  1655  shall then haue to preferre them. And the impediment
  1656  most profitably remoued, without the which there were
  1657  no expectation of our prosperitie
  1658  
  1659     Rodo. I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity
  1660  
  1661     Iago. I warrant thee. Meete me by and by at the
  1662  Cittadell. I must fetch his Necessaries a Shore. Farewell
  1663  
  1664     Rodo. Adieu.
  1665  Enter.
  1666  
  1667    Iago. That Cassio loues her, I do well beleeu't:
  1668  That she loues him, 'tis apt, and of great Credite.
  1669  The Moore (howbeit that I endure him not)
  1670  Is of a constant, louing, Noble Nature,
  1671  And I dare thinke, he'le proue to Desdemona
  1672  A most deere husband. Now I do loue her too,
  1673  Not out of absolute Lust, (though peraduenture
  1674  I stand accomptant for as great a sin)
  1675  But partely led to dyet my Reuenge,
  1676  For that I do suspect the lustie Moore
  1677  Hath leap'd into my Seate. The thought whereof,
  1678  Doth (like a poysonous Minerall) gnaw my Inwardes:
  1679  And nothing can, or shall content my Soule
  1680  Till I am eeuen'd with him, wife, for wife.
  1681  Or fayling so, yet that I put the Moore,
  1682  At least into a Ielouzie so strong
  1683  That iudgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,
  1684  If this poore Trash of Venice, whom I trace
  1685  For his quicke hunting, stand the putting on,
  1686  Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip,
  1687  Abuse him to the Moore, in the right garbe
  1688  (For I feare Cassio with my Night-Cape too)
  1689  Make the Moore thanke me, loue me, and reward me,
  1690  For making him egregiously an Asse,
  1691  And practising vpon his peace, and quiet,
  1692  Euen to madnesse. 'Tis heere: but yet confus'd,
  1693  Knaueries plaine face, is neuer seene, till vs'd.
  1694  Enter.
  1695  
  1696  
  1697  Scena Secunda.
  1698  
  1699  Enter Othello's Herald with a Proclamation.
  1700  
  1701    Herald. It is Othello's pleasure, our Noble and Valiant
  1702  Generall. That vpon certaine tydings now arriu'd,
  1703  importing the meere perdition of the Turkish Fleete:
  1704  euery man put himselfe into Triumph. Some to daunce,
  1705  some to make Bonfires, each man, to what Sport and
  1706  Reuels his addition leads him. For besides these beneficiall
  1707  Newes, it is the Celebration of his Nuptiall. So
  1708  much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices
  1709  are open, & there is full libertie of Feasting from this
  1710  present houre of fiue, till the Bell haue told eleuen.
  1711  Blesse the Isle of Cyprus, and our Noble Generall Othello.
  1712  Enter.
  1713  
  1714  Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.
  1715  
  1716    Othe. Good Michael, looke you to the guard to night.
  1717  Let's teach our selues that Honourable stop,
  1718  Not to out-sport discretion
  1719  
  1720     Cas. Iago, hath direction what to do.
  1721  But notwithstanding with my personall eye
  1722  Will I looke to't
  1723  
  1724     Othe. Iago, is most honest:
  1725  Michael, goodnight. To morrow with your earliest,
  1726  Let me haue speech with you. Come my deere Loue,
  1727  The purchase made, the fruites are to ensue,
  1728  That profit's yet to come 'tweene me, and you.
  1729  Goodnight.
  1730  Enter.
  1731  
  1732  Enter Iago.
  1733  
  1734    Cas. Welcome Iago: we must to the Watch
  1735  
  1736     Iago. Not this houre Lieutenant: 'tis not yet ten
  1737  o'th' clocke. Our Generall cast vs thus earely for the
  1738  loue of his Desdemona: Who, let vs not therefore blame;
  1739  he hath not yet made wanton the night with her: and
  1740  she is sport for Ioue
  1741  
  1742     Cas. She's a most exquisite Lady
  1743  
  1744     Iago. And Ile warrant her, full of Game
  1745  
  1746     Cas. Indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature
  1747  
  1748     Iago. What an eye she ha's?
  1749  Me thinkes it sounds a parley to prouocation
  1750  
  1751     Cas. An inuiting eye:
  1752  And yet me thinkes right modest
  1753  
  1754     Iago. And when she speakes,
  1755  Is it not an Alarum to Loue?
  1756    Cas. She is indeed perfection
  1757  
  1758     Iago. Well: happinesse to their Sheetes. Come Lieutenant,
  1759  I haue a stope of Wine, and heere without are a
  1760  brace of Cyprus Gallants, that would faine haue a measure
  1761  to the health of blacke Othello
  1762  
  1763     Cas. Not to night, good Iago, I haue very poore,
  1764  and vnhappie Braines for drinking. I could well wish
  1765  Curtesie would inuent some other Custome of entertainment
  1766  
  1767     Iago. Oh, they are our Friends: but one Cup, Ile
  1768  drinke for you
  1769  
  1770     Cassio. I haue drunke but one Cup to night, and that
  1771  was craftily qualified too: and behold what inouation
  1772  it makes heere. I am infortunate in the infirmity, and
  1773  dare not taske my weakenesse with any more
  1774  
  1775     Iago. What man? 'Tis a night of Reuels, the Gallants
  1776  desire it
  1777  
  1778     Cas. Where are they?
  1779    Iago. Heere, at the doore: I pray you call them in
  1780  
  1781     Cas. Ile do't, but it dislikes me.
  1782  Enter.
  1783  
  1784    Iago. If I can fasten but one Cup vpon him
  1785  With that which he hath drunke to night alreadie,
  1786  He'l be as full of Quarrell, and offence
  1787  As my yong Mistris dogge.
  1788  Now my sicke Foole Rodorigo,
  1789  Whom Loue hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
  1790  To Desdemona hath to night Carrows'd.
  1791  Potations, pottle-deepe; and he's to watch.
  1792  Three else of Cyprus, Noble swelling Spirites,
  1793  (That hold their Honours in a wary distance,
  1794  The very Elements of this Warrelike Isle)
  1795  Haue I to night fluster'd with flowing Cups,
  1796  And they Watch too.
  1797  Now 'mongst this Flocke of drunkards
  1798  Am I put to our Cassio in some Action
  1799  That may offend the Isle. But here they come.
  1800  Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen.
  1801  
  1802  If Consequence do but approue my dreame,
  1803  My Boate sailes freely, both with winde and Streame
  1804  
  1805     Cas. 'Fore heauen, they haue giuen me a rowse already
  1806  
  1807     Mon. Good-faith a litle one: not past a pint, as I am a
  1808  Souldier
  1809  
  1810     Iago. Some Wine hoa.
  1811  And let me the Cannakin clinke, clinke:
  1812  And let me the Cannakin clinke.
  1813  A Souldiers a man: Oh, mans life's but a span,
  1814  Why then let a Souldier drinke.
  1815  Some Wine Boyes
  1816  
  1817     Cas. 'Fore Heauen: an excellent Song
  1818  
  1819     Iago. I learn'd it in England: where indeed they are
  1820  most potent in Potting. Your Dane, your Germaine,
  1821  and your swag-belly'd Hollander, (drinke hoa) are
  1822  nothing to your English
  1823  
  1824     Cassio. Is your Englishmen so exquisite in his drinking?
  1825    Iago. Why, he drinkes you with facillitie, your Dane
  1826  dead drunke. He sweates not to ouerthrow your Almaine.
  1827  He giues your Hollander a vomit, ere the next
  1828  Pottle can be fill'd
  1829  
  1830     Cas. To the health of our Generall
  1831  
  1832     Mon. I am for it Lieutenant: and Ile do you Iustice
  1833  
  1834     Iago. Oh sweet England.
  1835  King Stephen was anda worthy Peere,
  1836  His Breeches cost him but a Crowne,
  1837  He held them Six pence all to deere,
  1838  With that he cal'd the Tailor Lowne:
  1839  He was a wight of high Renowne,
  1840  And thou art but of low degree:
  1841  'Tis Pride that pulls the Country downe,
  1842  And take thy awl'd Cloake about thee.
  1843  Some Wine hoa
  1844  
  1845     Cassio. Why this is a more exquisite Song then the other
  1846  
  1847     Iago. Will you heare't againe?
  1848    Cas. No: for I hold him to be vnworthy of his Place,
  1849  that do's those things. Well: heau'ns aboue all: and
  1850  there be soules must be saued, and there be soules must
  1851  not be saued
  1852  
  1853     Iago. It's true, good Lieutenant
  1854  
  1855     Cas. For mine owne part, no offence to the Generall,
  1856  nor any man of qualitie: I hope to be saued
  1857  
  1858     Iago. And so do I too Lieutenant
  1859  
  1860     Cassio. I: (but by your leaue) not before me. The
  1861  Lieutenant is to be saued before the Ancient. Let's haue
  1862  no more of this: let's to our Affaires. Forgiue vs our
  1863  sinnes: Gentlemen let's looke to our businesse. Do not
  1864  thinke Gentlemen, I am drunke: this is my Ancient, this
  1865  is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunke
  1866  now: I can stand well enough, and I speake well enough
  1867  
  1868     Gent. Excellent well
  1869  
  1870     Cas. Why very well then: you must not thinke then,
  1871  that I am drunke.
  1872  Enter.
  1873  
  1874    Monta. To th' Platforme (Masters) come, let's set the
  1875  Watch
  1876  
  1877     Iago. You see this Fellow, that is gone before,
  1878  He's a Souldier, fit to stand by Caesar,
  1879  And giue direction. And do but see his vice,
  1880  'Tis to his vertue, a iust Equinox,
  1881  The one as long as th' other. 'Tis pittie of him:
  1882  I feare the trust Othello puts him in,
  1883  On some odde time of his infirmitie
  1884  Will shake this Island
  1885  
  1886     Mont. But is he often thus?
  1887    Iago. 'Tis euermore his prologue to his sleepe,
  1888  He'le watch the Horologe a double Set,
  1889  If Drinke rocke not his Cradle
  1890  
  1891     Mont. It were well
  1892  The Generall were put in mind of it:
  1893  Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
  1894  Prizes the vertue that appeares in Cassio,
  1895  And lookes not on his euills: is not this true?
  1896  Enter Rodorigo.
  1897  
  1898    Iago. How now Rodorigo?
  1899  I pray you after the Lieutenant, go
  1900  
  1901     Mon. And 'tis great pitty, that the Noble Moore
  1902  Should hazard such a Place, as his owne Second
  1903  With one of an ingraft Infirmitie,
  1904  It were an honest Action, to say so
  1905  To the Moore
  1906  
  1907     Iago. Not I, for this faire Island,
  1908  I do loue Cassio well: and would do much
  1909  To cure him of this euill, But hearke, what noise?
  1910  Enter Cassio pursuing Rodorigo.
  1911  
  1912    Cas. You Rogue: you Rascall
  1913  
  1914     Mon. What's the matter Lieutenant?
  1915    Cas. A Knaue teach me my dutie? Ile beate the
  1916  Knaue in to a Twiggen-Bottle
  1917  
  1918     Rod. Beate me?
  1919    Cas. Dost thou prate, Rogue?
  1920    Mon. Nay, good Lieutenant:
  1921  I pray you Sir, hold your hand
  1922  
  1923     Cassio. Let me go (Sir)
  1924  Or Ile knocke you o're the Mazard
  1925  
  1926     Mon. Come, come: you're drunke
  1927  
  1928     Cassio. Drunke?
  1929    Iago. Away I say: go out and cry a Mutinie.
  1930  Nay good Lieutenant. Alas Gentlemen:
  1931  Helpe hoa. Lieutenant. Sir Montano:
  1932  Helpe Masters. Heere's a goodly Watch indeed.
  1933  Who's that which rings the Bell: Diablo, hoa:
  1934  The Towne will rise. Fie, fie Lieutenant,
  1935  You'le be asham'd for euer.
  1936  Enter Othello, and Attendants.
  1937  
  1938    Othe. What is the matter heere?
  1939    Mon. I bleed still, I am hurt to th' death. He dies
  1940  
  1941     Othe. Hold for your liues
  1942  
  1943     Iag. Hold hoa: Lieutenant, Sir Montano, Gentlemen:
  1944  Haue you forgot all place of sense and dutie?
  1945  Hold. The Generall speaks to you: hold for shame
  1946  
  1947     Oth. Why how now hoa? From whence ariseth this?
  1948  Are we turn'd Turkes? and to our selues do that
  1949  Which Heauen hath forbid the Ottamittes.
  1950  For Christian shame, put by this barbarous Brawle:
  1951  He that stirs next, to carue for his owne rage,
  1952  Holds his soule light: He dies vpon his Motion.
  1953  Silence that dreadfull Bell, it frights the Isle,
  1954  From her propriety. What is the matter, Masters?
  1955  Honest Iago, that lookes dead with greeuing,
  1956  Speake: who began this? On thy loue I charge thee?
  1957    Iago. I do not know: Friends all, but now, euen now.
  1958  In Quarter, and in termes like Bride, and Groome
  1959  Deuesting them for Bed: and then, but now:
  1960  (As if some Planet had vnwitted men)
  1961  Swords out, and tilting one at others breastes,
  1962  In opposition bloody. I cannot speake
  1963  Any begining to this peeuish oddes.
  1964  And would, in Action glorious, I had lost
  1965  Those legges, that brought me to a part of it
  1966  
  1967     Othe. How comes it (Michaell) you are thus forgot?
  1968    Cas. I pray you pardon me, I cannot speake
  1969  
  1970     Othe. Worthy Montano, you were wont to be ciuill:
  1971  The grauitie, and stillnesse of your youth
  1972  The world hath noted. And your name is great
  1973  In mouthes of wisest Censure. What's the matter
  1974  That you vnlace your reputation thus,
  1975  And spend your rich opinion, for the name
  1976  Of a night-brawler? Giue me answer to it
  1977  
  1978     Mon. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger,
  1979  Your Officer Iago, can informe you,
  1980  While I spare speech which something now offends me.
  1981  Of all that I do know, nor know I ought
  1982  By me, that's said, or done amisse this night,
  1983  Vnlesse selfe-charitie be sometimes a vice,
  1984  And to defend our selues, it be a sinne
  1985  When violence assailes vs
  1986  
  1987     Othe. Now by Heauen,
  1988  My blood begins my safer Guides to rule,
  1989  And passion (hauing my best iudgement collied)
  1990  Assaies to leade the way. If I once stir,
  1991  Or do but lift this Arme, the best of you
  1992  Shall sinke in my rebuke. Giue me to know
  1993  How this foule Rout began: Who set it on,
  1994  And he that is approu'd in this offence,
  1995  Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
  1996  Shall loose me. What in a Towne of warre,
  1997  Yet wilde, the peoples hearts brim-full of feare,
  1998  To Manage priuate, and domesticke Quarrell?
  1999  In night, and on the Court and Guard of safetie?
  2000  'Tis monstrous: Iago, who began't?
  2001    Mon. If partially Affin'd, or league in office,
  2002  Thou dost deliuer more, or lesse then Truth,
  2003  Thou art no Souldier
  2004  
  2005     Iago. Touch me not so neere,
  2006  I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth,
  2007  Then it should do offence to Michaell Cassio.
  2008  Yet I perswade my selfe, to speake the truth
  2009  Shall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall:
  2010  Montano and my selfe being in speech,
  2011  There comes a Fellow, crying out for helpe,
  2012  And Cassio following him with determin'd Sword
  2013  To execute vpon him. Sir, this Gentleman,
  2014  Steppes in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
  2015  My selfe, the crying Fellow did pursue,
  2016  Least by his clamour (as it so fell out)
  2017  The Towne might fall in fright. He, (swift of foote)
  2018  Out-ran my purpose: and I return'd then rather
  2019  For that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords,
  2020  And Cassio high in oath: Which till to night
  2021  I nere might say before. When I came backe
  2022  (For this was briefe) I found them close together
  2023  At blow, and thrust, euen as againe they were
  2024  When you your selfe did part them.
  2025  More of this matter cannot I report,
  2026  But Men are Men: The best sometimes forget,
  2027  Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
  2028  As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
  2029  Yet surely Cassio, I beleeue receiu'd
  2030  From him that fled, some strange Indignitie,
  2031  Which patience could not passe
  2032  
  2033     Othe. I know Iago
  2034  Thy honestie, and loue doth mince this matter,
  2035  Making it light to Cassio: Cassio, I loue thee,
  2036  But neuer more be Officer of mine.
  2037  Enter Desdemona attended.
  2038  
  2039  Looke if my gentle Loue be not rais'd vp:
  2040  Ile make thee an example
  2041  
  2042     Des. What is the matter (Deere?)
  2043    Othe. All's well, Sweeting:
  2044  Come away to bed. Sir for your hurts,
  2045  My selfe will be your Surgeon. Lead him off:
  2046  Iago, looke with care about the Towne,
  2047  And silence those whom this vil'd brawle distracted.
  2048  Come Desdemona, 'tis the Soldiers life,
  2049  To haue their Balmy slumbers wak'd with strife.
  2050  Enter.
  2051  
  2052    Iago. What are you hurt Lieutenant?
  2053    Cas. I, past all Surgery
  2054  
  2055     Iago. Marry Heauen forbid
  2056  
  2057     Cas. Reputation, Reputation, Reputation: Oh I haue
  2058  lost my Reputation. I haue lost the immortall part of
  2059  myselfe, and what remaines is bestiall. My Reputation,
  2060  Iago, my Reputation
  2061  
  2062     Iago. As I am an honest man I had thought you had
  2063  receiued some bodily wound; there is more sence in that
  2064  then in Reputation. Reputation is an idle, and most false
  2065  imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deseruing.
  2066  You haue lost no Reputation at all, vnlesse you
  2067  repute your selfe such a looser. What man, there are
  2068  more wayes to recouer the Generall againe. You are
  2069  but now cast in his moode, (a punishment more in policie,
  2070  then in malice) euen so as one would beate his offencelesse
  2071  dogge, to affright an Imperious Lyon. Sue to
  2072  him againe, and he's yours
  2073  
  2074     Cas. I will rather sue to be despis'd, then to deceiue
  2075  so good a Commander, with so slight, so drunken, and so
  2076  indiscreet an Officer. Drunke? And speake Parrat? And
  2077  squabble? Swagger? Sweare? And discourse Fustian
  2078  with ones owne shadow? Oh thou invisible spirit of
  2079  Wine, if thou hast no name to be knowne by, let vs call
  2080  thee Diuell
  2081  
  2082     Iago. What was he that you follow'd with your
  2083  Sword? What had he done to you?
  2084    Cas. I know not
  2085  
  2086     Iago. Is't possible?
  2087    Cas. I remember a masse of things, but nothing distinctly:
  2088  a Quarrell, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that
  2089  men should put an Enemie in their mouthes, to steale away
  2090  their Braines? that we should with ioy, pleasance,
  2091  reuell and applause, transforme our selues into Beasts
  2092  
  2093     Iago. Why? But you are now well enough: how
  2094  came you thus recouered?
  2095    Cas. It hath pleas'd the diuell drunkennesse, to giue
  2096  place to the diuell wrath, one vnperfectnesse, shewes me
  2097  another to make me frankly despise my selfe
  2098  
  2099     Iago. Come, you are too seuere a Moraller. As the
  2100  Time, the Place, & the Condition of this Country stands
  2101  I could hartily wish this had not befalne: but since it is, as
  2102  it is, mend it for your owne good
  2103  
  2104     Cas. I will aske him for my Place againe, he shall tell
  2105  me, I am a drunkard: had I as many mouthes as Hydra,
  2106  such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible
  2107  man, by and by a Foole, and presently a Beast. Oh
  2108  strange! Euery inordinate cup is vnbless'd, and the Ingredient
  2109  is a diuell
  2110  
  2111     Iago. Come, come: good wine, is a good familiar
  2112  Creature, if it be well vs'd: exclaime no more against it.
  2113  And good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue
  2114  you
  2115  
  2116     Cassio. I haue well approued it, Sir. I drunke?
  2117    Iago. You, or any man liuing, may be drunke at a
  2118  time man. I tell you what you shall do: Our General's
  2119  Wife, is now the Generall. I may say so, in this respect,
  2120  for that he hath deuoted, and giuen vp himselfe to the
  2121  Contemplation, marke: and deuotement of her parts
  2122  and Graces. Confesse your selfe freely to her: Importune
  2123  her helpe to put you in your place againe. She is
  2124  of so free, so kinde, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
  2125  she holds it a vice in her goodnesse, not to do more
  2126  then she is requested. This broken ioynt betweene
  2127  you, and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my
  2128  Fortunes against any lay worth naming, this cracke of
  2129  your Loue, shall grow stronger, then it was before
  2130  
  2131     Cassio. You aduise me well
  2132  
  2133     Iago. I protest in the sinceritie of Loue, and honest
  2134  kindnesse
  2135  
  2136     Cassio. I thinke it freely: and betimes in the morning,
  2137  I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake
  2138  for me: I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me
  2139  
  2140     Iago. You are in the right: good night Lieutenant, I
  2141  must to the Watch
  2142  
  2143     Cassio. Good night, honest Iago.
  2144  
  2145  Exit Cassio.
  2146  
  2147    Iago. And what's he then,
  2148  That saies I play the Villaine?
  2149  When this aduise is free I giue, and honest,
  2150  Proball to thinking, and indeed the course
  2151  To win the Moore againe.
  2152  For 'tis most easie
  2153  Th' inclyning Desdemona to subdue
  2154  In any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull
  2155  As the free Elements. And then for her
  2156  To win the Moore, were to renownce his Baptisme,
  2157  All Seales, and Simbols of redeemed sin:
  2158  His Soule is so enfetter'd to her Loue,
  2159  That she may make, vnmake, do what she list,
  2160  Euen as her Appetite shall play the God,
  2161  With his weake Function. How am I then a Villaine,
  2162  To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course,
  2163  Directly to his good? Diuinitie of hell,
  2164  When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on,
  2165  They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes,
  2166  As I do now. For whiles this honest Foole
  2167  Plies Desdemona, to repaire his Fortune,
  2168  And she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore,
  2169  Ile powre this pestilence into his eare:
  2170  That she repeales him, for her bodies Lust,
  2171  And by how much she striues to do him good,
  2172  She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore.
  2173  So will I turne her vertue into pitch.
  2174  And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net,
  2175  That shall en-mash them all.
  2176  How now Rodorigo?
  2177  Enter Rodorigo.
  2178  
  2179    Rodorigo. I do follow heere in the Chace, not
  2180  like a Hound that hunts, but one that filles vp the
  2181  Crie. My Money is almost spent; I haue bin to night
  2182  exceedingly well Cudgell'd: And I thinke the issue
  2183  will bee, I shall haue so much experience for my paines;
  2184  And so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, returne
  2185  againe to Venice
  2186  
  2187     Iago. How poore are they that haue not Patience?
  2188  What wound did euer heale but by degrees?
  2189  Thou know'st we worke by Wit, and not by Witchcraft
  2190  And Wit depends on dilatory time:
  2191  Dos't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
  2192  And thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd Cassio:
  2193  Though other things grow faire against the Sun,
  2194  Yet Fruites that blossome first, will first be ripe:
  2195  Content thy selfe, a-while. Introth 'tis Morning;
  2196  Pleasure, and Action, make the houres seeme short.
  2197  Retire thee, go where thou art Billited:
  2198  Away, I say, thou shalt know more heereafter:
  2199  Nay get thee gone.
  2200  
  2201  Exit Roderigo.
  2202  
  2203  Two things are to be done:
  2204  My Wife must moue for Cassio to her Mistris:
  2205  Ile set her on my selfe, a while, to draw the Moor apart,
  2206  And bring him iumpe, when he may Cassio finde
  2207  Soliciting his wife: I, that's the way:
  2208  Dull not Deuice, by coldnesse, and delay.
  2209  Enter.
  2210  
  2211  
  2212  Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.
  2213  
  2214  Enter Cassio, Musitians, and Clowne.
  2215  
  2216    Cassio. Masters, play heere, I wil content your paines,
  2217  Something that's briefe: and bid, goodmorrow General
  2218  
  2219     Clo. Why Masters, haue your Instruments bin in Naples,
  2220  that they speake i'th' Nose thus?
  2221    Mus. How Sir? how?
  2222    Clo. Are these I pray you, winde Instruments?
  2223    Mus. I marry are they sir
  2224  
  2225     Clo. Oh, thereby hangs a tale
  2226  
  2227     Mus. Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
  2228    Clow. Marry sir, by many a winde Instrument that I
  2229  know. But Masters, heere's money for you: and the Generall
  2230  so likes your Musick, that he desires you for loues
  2231  sake to make no more noise with it
  2232  
  2233     Mus. Well Sir, we will not
  2234  
  2235     Clo. If you haue any Musicke that may not be heard,
  2236  too't againe. But (as they say) to heare Musicke, the Generall
  2237  do's not greatly care
  2238  
  2239     Mus. We haue none such, sir
  2240  
  2241     Clow. Then put vp your Pipes in your bagge, for Ile
  2242  away. Go, vanish into ayre, away.
  2243  
  2244  Exit Mu.
  2245  
  2246    Cassio. Dost thou heare me, mine honest Friend?
  2247    Clo. No, I heare not your honest Friend:
  2248  I heare you
  2249  
  2250     Cassio. Prythee keepe vp thy Quillets, ther's a poore
  2251  peece of Gold for thee: if the Gentlewoman that attends
  2252  the Generall be stirring, tell her, there's one Cassio entreats
  2253  her a little fauour of Speech. Wilt thou do this?
  2254    Clo. She is stirring sir: if she will stirre hither, I shall
  2255  seeme to notifie vnto her.
  2256  
  2257  Exit Clo.
  2258  
  2259  Enter Iago.
  2260  
  2261  In happy time, Iago
  2262  
  2263     Iago. You haue not bin a-bed then?
  2264    Cassio. Why no: the day had broke before we parted.
  2265  I haue made bold (Iago) to send in to your wife:
  2266  My suite to her is, that she will to vertuous Desdemona
  2267  Procure me some accesse
  2268  
  2269     Iago. Ile send her to you presently:
  2270  And Ile deuise a meane to draw the Moore
  2271  Out of the way, that your conuerse and businesse
  2272  May be more free.
  2273  
  2274  Exit
  2275  
  2276    Cassio. I humbly thanke you for't. I neuer knew
  2277  A Florentine more kinde, and honest.
  2278  Enter aemilia.
  2279  
  2280  Aemil. Goodmorrow (good Lieutenant) I am sorrie
  2281  For your displeasure: but all will sure be well.
  2282  The Generall and his wife are talking of it,
  2283  And she speakes for you stoutly. The Moore replies,
  2284  That he you hurt is of great Fame in Cyprus,
  2285  And great Affinitie: and that in wholsome Wisedome
  2286  He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loues you
  2287  And needs no other Suitor, but his likings
  2288  To bring you in againe
  2289  
  2290     Cassio. Yet I beseech you,
  2291  If you thinke fit, or that it may be done,
  2292  Giue me aduantage of some breefe Discourse
  2293  With Desdemon alone.
  2294  Aemil. Pray you come in:
  2295  I will bestow you where you shall haue time
  2296  To speake your bosome freely
  2297  
  2298     Cassio. I am much bound to you.
  2299  
  2300  Scoena Secunda.
  2301  
  2302  Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.
  2303  
  2304    Othe. These Letters giue (Iago) to the Pylot,
  2305  And by him do my duties to the Senate:
  2306  That done, I will be walking on the Workes,
  2307  Repaire there to mee
  2308  
  2309     Iago. Well, my good Lord, Ile doo't
  2310  
  2311     Oth. This Fortification (Gentlemen) shall we see't?
  2312    Gent. Well waite vpon your Lordship.
  2313  
  2314  Exeunt.
  2315  
  2316  Scoena Tertia.
  2317  
  2318  Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and aemilia.
  2319  
  2320    Des. Be thou assur'd (good Cassio) I will do
  2321  All my abilities in thy behalfe.
  2322  Aemil. Good Madam do:
  2323  I warrant it greeues my Husband,
  2324  As if the cause were his
  2325  
  2326     Des. Oh that's an honest Fellow, Do not doubt Cassio
  2327  But I will haue my Lord, and you againe
  2328  As friendly as you were
  2329  
  2330     Cassio. Bounteous Madam,
  2331  What euer shall become of Michael Cassio,
  2332  He's neuer any thing but your true Seruant
  2333  
  2334     Des. I know't: I thanke you: you do loue my Lord:
  2335  You haue knowne him long, and be you well assur'd
  2336  He shall in strangenesse stand no farther off,
  2337  Then in a politique distance
  2338  
  2339     Cassio. I, but Lady,
  2340  That policie may either last so long,
  2341  Or feede vpon such nice and waterish diet,
  2342  Or breede it selfe so out of Circumstances,
  2343  That I being absent, and my place supply'd,
  2344  My Generall will forget my Loue, and Seruice
  2345  
  2346     Des. Do not doubt that: before aemilia here,
  2347  I giue thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
  2348  If I do vow a friendship, Ile performe it
  2349  To the last Article. My Lord shall neuer rest,
  2350  Ile watch him tame, and talke him out of patience;
  2351  His Bed shall seeme a Schoole, his Boord a Shrift,
  2352  Ile intermingle euery thing he do's
  2353  With Cassio's suite: Therefore be merry Cassio,
  2354  For thy Solicitor shall rather dye,
  2355  Then giue thy cause away.
  2356  Enter Othello, and Iago.
  2357  
  2358  Aemil. Madam, heere comes my Lord
  2359  
  2360     Cassio. Madam, Ile take my leaue
  2361  
  2362     Des. Why stay, and heare me speake
  2363  
  2364     Cassio. Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
  2365  Vnfit for mine owne purposes
  2366  
  2367     Des. Well, do your discretion.
  2368  
  2369  Exit Cassio.
  2370  
  2371    Iago. Hah? I like not that
  2372  
  2373     Othel. What dost thou say?
  2374    Iago. Nothing my Lord; or if- I know not what
  2375  
  2376     Othel. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
  2377    Iago. Cassio my Lord? No sure, I cannot thinke it
  2378  That he would steale away so guilty-like,
  2379  Seeing your comming
  2380  
  2381     Oth. I do beleeue 'twas he
  2382  
  2383     Des. How now my Lord?
  2384  I haue bin talking with a Suitor heere,
  2385  A man that languishes in your displeasure
  2386  
  2387     Oth. Who is't you meane?
  2388    Des. Why your Lieutenant Cassio: Good my Lord,
  2389  If I haue any grace, or power to moue you,
  2390  His present reconciliation take.
  2391  For if he be not one, that truly loues you,
  2392  That erres in Ignorance, and not in Cunning,
  2393  I haue no iudgement in an honest face.
  2394  I prythee call him backe
  2395  
  2396     Oth. Went he hence now?
  2397    Des. I sooth; so humbled,
  2398  That he hath left part of his greefe with mee
  2399  To suffer with him. Good Loue, call him backe
  2400  
  2401     Othel. Not now (sweet Desdemon) some other time
  2402  
  2403     Des. But shall't be shortly?
  2404    Oth. The sooner (Sweet) for you
  2405  
  2406     Des. Shall't be to night, at Supper?
  2407    Oth. No, not to night
  2408  
  2409     Des. To morrow Dinner then?
  2410    Oth. I shall not dine at home:
  2411  I meete the Captaines at the Cittadell
  2412  
  2413     Des. Why then to morrow night, on Tuesday morne,
  2414  On Tuesday noone, or night; on Wensday Morne.
  2415  I prythee name the time, but let it not
  2416  Exceed three dayes. Infaith hee's penitent:
  2417  And yet his Trespasse, in our common reason
  2418  (Saue that they say the warres must make example)
  2419  Out of her best, is not almost a fault
  2420  T' encurre a priuate checke. When shall he come?
  2421  Tell me Othello. I wonder in my Soule
  2422  What you would aske me, that I should deny,
  2423  Or stand so mam'ring on? What? Michael Cassio,
  2424  That came a woing with you? and so many a time
  2425  (When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly)
  2426  Hath tane your part, to haue so much to do
  2427  To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much
  2428  
  2429     Oth. Prythee no more: Let him come when he will:
  2430  I will deny thee nothing
  2431  
  2432     Des. Why, this is not a Boone:
  2433  'Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues,
  2434  Or feede on nourishing dishes, or keepe you warme,
  2435  Or sue to you, to do a peculiar profit
  2436  To your owne person. Nay, when I haue a suite
  2437  Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed,
  2438  It shall be full of poize, and difficult waight,
  2439  And fearefull to be granted
  2440  
  2441     Oth. I will deny thee nothing.
  2442  Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
  2443  To leaue me but a little to my selfe
  2444  
  2445     Des. Shall I deny you? No: farewell my Lord
  2446  
  2447     Oth. Farewell my Desdemona, Ile come to thee strait
  2448  
  2449     Des. aemilia come; be as your Fancies teach you:
  2450  What ere you be, I am obedient.
  2451  Enter.
  2452  
  2453    Oth. Excellent wretch: Perdition catch my Soule
  2454  But I do loue thee: and when I loue thee not,
  2455  Chaos is come againe
  2456  
  2457     Iago. My Noble Lord
  2458  
  2459     Oth. What dost thou say, Iago?
  2460    Iago. Did Michael Cassio
  2461  When he woo'd my Lady, know of your loue?
  2462    Oth. He did, from first to last:
  2463  Why dost thou aske?
  2464    Iago. But for a satisfaction of my Thought,
  2465  No further harme
  2466  
  2467     Oth. Why of thy thought, Iago?
  2468    Iago. I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir
  2469  
  2470     Oth. O yes, and went betweene vs very oft
  2471  
  2472     Iago. Indeed?
  2473    Oth. Indeed? I indeed. Discern'st thou ought in that?
  2474  Is he not honest?
  2475    Iago. Honest, my Lord?
  2476    Oth. Honest? I, Honest
  2477  
  2478     Iago. My Lord, for ought I know
  2479  
  2480     Oth. What do'st thou thinke?
  2481    Iago. Thinke, my Lord?
  2482    Oth. Thinke, my Lord? Alas, thou ecchos't me;
  2483  As if there were some Monster in thy thought
  2484  Too hideous to be shewne. Thou dost mean somthing:
  2485  I heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that,
  2486  When Cassio left my wife. What didd'st not like?
  2487  And when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile,
  2488  Of my whole course of wooing; thou cried'st, Indeede?
  2489  And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,
  2490  As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine
  2491  Some horrible Conceite. If thou do'st loue me,
  2492  Shew me thy thought
  2493  
  2494     Iago. My Lord, you know I loue you
  2495  
  2496     Oth. I thinke thou do'st:
  2497  And for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie,
  2498  And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,
  2499  Therefore these stops of thine, fright me the more:
  2500  For such things in a false disloyall Knaue
  2501  Are trickes of Custome: but in a man that's iust,
  2502  They're close dilations, working from the heart,
  2503  That Passion cannot rule
  2504  
  2505     Iago. For Michael Cassio,
  2506  I dare be sworne, I thinke that he is honest
  2507  
  2508     Oth. I thinke so too
  2509  
  2510     Iago. Men should be what they seeme,
  2511  Or those that be not, would they might seeme none
  2512  
  2513     Oth. Certaine, men should be what they seeme
  2514  
  2515     Iago. Why then I thinke Cassio's an honest man
  2516  
  2517     Oth. Nay, yet there's more in this?
  2518  I prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings,
  2519  As thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts
  2520  The worst of words
  2521  
  2522     Iago. Good my Lord pardon me,
  2523  Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie,
  2524  I am not bound to that: All Slaues are free:
  2525  Vtter my Thoughts? Why say, they are vild, and falce?
  2526  As where's that Palace, whereinto foule things
  2527  Sometimes intrude not? Who ha's that breast so pure,
  2528  Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions
  2529  Keepe Leetes, and Law-dayes, and in Sessions sit
  2530  With meditations lawfull?
  2531    Oth. Thou do'st conspire against thy Friend (Iago)
  2532  If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his eare
  2533  A stranger to thy Thoughts
  2534  
  2535     Iago. I do beseech you,
  2536  Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse
  2537  (As I confesse it is my Natures plague
  2538  To spy into Abuses, and of my iealousie
  2539  Shapes faults that are not) that your wisedome
  2540  From one, that so imperfectly conceits,
  2541  Would take no notice, nor build your selfe a trouble
  2542  Out of his scattering, and vnsure obseruance:
  2543  It were not for your quiet, nor your good,
  2544  Nor for my Manhood, Honesty, and Wisedome,
  2545  To let you know my thoughts
  2546  
  2547     Oth. What dost thou meane?
  2548    Iago. Good name in Man, & woman (deere my Lord)
  2549  Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules;
  2550  Who steales my purse, steales trash:
  2551  'Tis something, nothing;
  2552  'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has bin slaue to thousands:
  2553  But he that filches from me my good Name,
  2554  Robs me of that, which not enriches him,
  2555  And makes me poore indeed
  2556  
  2557     Oth. Ile know thy Thoughts
  2558  
  2559     Iago. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,
  2560  Nor shall not, whil'st 'tis in my custodie
  2561  
  2562     Oth. Ha?
  2563    Iago. Oh, beware my Lord, of iealousie,
  2564  It is the greene-ey'd Monster, which doth mocke
  2565  The meate it feeds on. That Cuckold liues in blisse,
  2566  Who certaine of his Fate, loues not his wronger:
  2567  But oh, what damned minutes tels he ore,
  2568  Who dotes, yet doubts: Suspects, yet soundly loues?
  2569    Oth. O miserie
  2570  
  2571     Iago. Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough,
  2572  But Riches finelesse, is as poore as Winter,
  2573  To him that euer feares he shall be poore:
  2574  Good Heauen, the Soules of all my Tribe defend
  2575  From Iealousie
  2576  
  2577     Oth. Why? why is this?
  2578  Think'st thou, I'ld make a Life of Iealousie;
  2579  To follow still the changes of the Moone
  2580  With fresh suspitions? No: to be once in doubt,
  2581  Is to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat,
  2582  When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule
  2583  To such exufflicate, and blow'd Surmises,
  2584  Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me Iealious,
  2585  To say my wife is faire, feeds well, loues company,
  2586  Is free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances:
  2587  Where Vertue is, these are more vertuous.
  2588  Nor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw
  2589  The smallest feare, or doubt of her reuolt,
  2590  For she had eyes, and chose me. No Iago,
  2591  Ile see before I doubt; when I doubt, proue;
  2592  And on the proofe, there is no more but this,
  2593  Away at once with Loue, or Iealousie
  2594  
  2595     Ia. I am glad of this: For now I shall haue reason
  2596  To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you
  2597  With franker spirit. Therefore (as I am bound)
  2598  Receiue it from me. I speake not yet of proofe:
  2599  Looke to your wife, obserue her well with Cassio,
  2600  Weare your eyes, thus: not Iealious, nor Secure:
  2601  I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,
  2602  Out of selfe-Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't:
  2603  I know our Country disposition well:
  2604  In Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes
  2605  They dare not shew their Husbands.
  2606  Their best Conscience,
  2607  Is not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne
  2608  
  2609     Oth. Dost thou say so?
  2610    Iago. She did deceiue her Father, marrying you,
  2611  And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,
  2612  She lou'd them most
  2613  
  2614     Oth. And so she did
  2615  
  2616     Iago. Why go too then:
  2617  Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming
  2618  To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake,
  2619  He thought 'twas Witchcraft.
  2620  But I am much too blame:
  2621  I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
  2622  For too much louing you
  2623  
  2624     Oth. I am bound to thee for euer
  2625  
  2626     Iago. I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits:
  2627    Oth. Not a iot, not a iot
  2628  
  2629     Iago. Trust me, I feare it has:
  2630  I hope you will consider what is spoke
  2631  Comes from your Loue.
  2632  But I do see y'are moou'd:
  2633  I am to pray you, not to straine my speech
  2634  To grosser issues, nor to larger reach,
  2635  Then to Suspition
  2636  
  2637     Oth. I will not
  2638  
  2639     Iago. Should you do so (my Lord)
  2640  My speech should fall into such vilde successe,
  2641  Which my Thoughts aym'd not.
  2642  Cassio's my worthy Friend:
  2643  My Lord, I see y'are mou'd
  2644  
  2645     Oth. No, not much mou'd:
  2646  I do not thinke but Desdemona's honest
  2647  
  2648     Iago. Long liue she so;
  2649  And long liue you to thinke so
  2650  
  2651     Oth. And yet how Nature erring from it selfe
  2652  
  2653     Iago. I, there's the point:
  2654  As (to be bold with you)
  2655  Not to affect many proposed Matches
  2656  Of her owne Clime, Complexion, and Degree,
  2657  Whereto we see in all things, Nature tends:
  2658  Foh, one may smel in such, a will most ranke,
  2659  Foule disproportions, Thoughts vnnaturall.
  2660  But (pardon me) I do not in position
  2661  Distinctly speake of her, though I may feare
  2662  Her will, recoyling to her better iudgement,
  2663  May fal to match you with her Country formes,
  2664  And happily repent
  2665  
  2666     Oth. Farewell, farewell:
  2667  If more thou dost perceiue, let me know more:
  2668  Set on thy wife to obserue.
  2669  Leaue me Iago
  2670  
  2671     Iago. My Lord, I take my leaue
  2672  
  2673     Othel. Why did I marry?
  2674  This honest Creature (doubtlesse)
  2675  Sees, and knowes more, much more then he vnfolds
  2676  
  2677     Iago. My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor
  2678  To scan this thing no farther: Leaue it to time,
  2679  Although 'tis fit that Cassio haue his Place;
  2680  For sure he filles it vp with great Ability;
  2681  Yet if you please, to him off a-while:
  2682  You shall by that perceiue him, and his meanes:
  2683  Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment
  2684  With any strong, or vehement importunitie,
  2685  Much will be seene in that: In the meane time,
  2686  Let me be thought too busie in my feares,
  2687  (As worthy cause I haue to feare I am)
  2688  And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor
  2689  
  2690     Oth. Feare not my gouernment
  2691  
  2692     Iago. I once more take my leaue.
  2693  Enter.
  2694  
  2695    Oth. This Fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  2696  And knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit
  2697  Of humane dealings. If I do proue her Haggard,
  2698  Though that her Iesses were my deere heart-strings,
  2699  I'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde
  2700  To prey at Fortune. Haply, for I am blacke,
  2701  And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation
  2702  That Chamberers haue: Or for I am declin'd
  2703  Into the vale of yeares (yet that's not much)
  2704  Shee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe
  2705  Must be to loath her. Oh Curse of Marriage!
  2706  That we can call these delicate Creatures ours,
  2707  And not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad,
  2708  And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,
  2709  Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue
  2710  For others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great-ones,
  2711  Prerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base,
  2712  'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death:
  2713  Euen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs,
  2714  When we do quicken. Looke where she comes:
  2715  Enter Desdemona and aemilia.
  2716  
  2717  If she be false, Heauen mock'd it selfe:
  2718  Ile not beleeue't
  2719  
  2720     Des. How now, my deere Othello?
  2721  Your dinner, and the generous Islanders
  2722  By you inuited, do attend your presence
  2723  
  2724     Oth. I am too blame
  2725  
  2726     Des. Why do you speake so faintly?
  2727  Are you not well?
  2728    Oth. I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere
  2729  
  2730     Des. Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe.
  2731  Let me but binde it hard, within this houre
  2732  It will be well
  2733  
  2734     Oth. Your Napkin is too little:
  2735  Let it alone: Come, Ile go in with you.
  2736  Enter.
  2737  
  2738    Des. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  2739  Aemil. I am glad I haue found this Napkin:
  2740  This was her first remembrance from the Moore,
  2741  My wayward Husband hath a hundred times
  2742  Woo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token,
  2743  (For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it)
  2744  That she reserues it euermore about her,
  2745  To kisse, and talke too. Ile haue the worke tane out,
  2746  And giu't Iago: what he will do with it
  2747  Heauen knowes, not I:
  2748  I nothing, but to please his Fantasie.
  2749  Enter Iago.
  2750  
  2751    Iago. How now? What do you heere alone?
  2752  Aemil. Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you
  2753  
  2754     Iago. You haue a thing for me?
  2755  It is a common thing-
  2756  Aemil. Hah?
  2757    Iago. To haue a foolish wife.
  2758  Aemil. Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now
  2759  For that same Handkerchiefe
  2760  
  2761     Iago. What Handkerchiefe?
  2762  Aemil. What Handkerchiefe?
  2763  Why that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona,
  2764  That which so often you did bid me steale
  2765  
  2766     Iago. Hast stolne it from her?
  2767  Aemil. No: but she let it drop by negligence,
  2768  And to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp:
  2769  Looke, heere 'tis
  2770  
  2771     Iago. A good wench, giue it me.
  2772  Aemil. What will you do with't, that you haue bene
  2773  so earnest to haue me filch it?
  2774    Iago. Why, what is that to you?
  2775  Aemil. If it be not for some purpose of import,
  2776  Giu't me againe. Poore Lady, shee'l run mad
  2777  When she shall lacke it
  2778  
  2779     Iago. Be not acknowne on't:
  2780  I haue vse for it. Go, leaue me.
  2781  
  2782  Exit aemil.
  2783  
  2784  I will in Cassio's Lodging loose this Napkin,
  2785  And let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre,
  2786  Are to the iealious, confirmations strong,
  2787  As proofes of holy Writ. This may do something.
  2788  The Moore already changes with my poyson:
  2789  Dangerous conceites, are in their Natures poysons,
  2790  Which at the first are scarse found to distaste:
  2791  But with a little acte vpon the blood,
  2792  Burne like the Mines of Sulphure. I did say so.
  2793  Enter Othello.
  2794  
  2795  Looke where he comes: Not Poppy, nor Mandragora,
  2796  Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world
  2797  Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe
  2798  Which thou owd'st yesterday
  2799  
  2800     Oth. Ha, ha, false to mee?
  2801    Iago. Why how now Generall? No more of that
  2802  
  2803     Oth. Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke:
  2804  I sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd,
  2805  Then but to know't a little
  2806  
  2807     Iago. How now, my Lord?
  2808    Oth. What sense had I, in her stolne houres of Lust?
  2809  I saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me:
  2810  I slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie.
  2811  I found not Cassio's kisses on her Lippes:
  2812  He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolne,
  2813  Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all
  2814  
  2815     Iago. I am sorry to heare this?
  2816    Oth. I had beene happy, if the generall Campe,
  2817  Pyoners and all, had tasted her sweet Body,
  2818  So I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer
  2819  Farewell the Tranquill minde; farewell Content;
  2820  Farewell the plumed Troopes, and the bigge Warres,
  2821  That makes Ambition, Vertue! Oh farewell,
  2822  Farewell the neighing Steed, and the shrill Trumpe,
  2823  The Spirit-stirring Drum, th' Eare-piercing Fife,
  2824  The Royall Banner, and all Qualitie,
  2825  Pride, Pompe, and Circumstance of glorious Warre:
  2826  And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates
  2827  Th' immortall Ioues dread Clamours, counterfet,
  2828  Farewell: Othello's Occupation's gone
  2829  
  2830     Iago. Is't possible my Lord?
  2831    Oth. Villaine, be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore;
  2832  Be sure of it: Giue me the Occular proofe,
  2833  Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule,
  2834  Thou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog
  2835  Then answer my wak'd wrath
  2836  
  2837     Iago. Is't come to this?
  2838    Oth. Make me to see't: or (at the least) so proue it,
  2839  That the probation beare no Hindge, nor Loope,
  2840  To hang a doubt on: Or woe vpon thy life
  2841  
  2842     Iago. My Noble Lord
  2843  
  2844     Oth. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,
  2845  Neuer pray more: Abandon all remorse
  2846  On Horrors head, Horrors accumulate:
  2847  Do deeds to make Heauen weepe, all Earth amaz'd;
  2848  For nothing canst thou to damnation adde,
  2849  Greater then that
  2850  
  2851     Iago. O Grace! O Heauen forgiue me!
  2852  Are you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense?
  2853  God buy you: take mine Office. Oh wretched Foole,
  2854  That lou'st to make thine Honesty, a Vice!
  2855  Oh monstrous world! Take note, take note (O World)
  2856  To be direct and honest, is not safe.
  2857  I thanke you for this profit, and from hence
  2858  Ile loue no Friend, sith Loue breeds such offence
  2859  
  2860     Oth. Nay stay: thou should'st be honest
  2861  
  2862     Iago. I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole,
  2863  And looses that it workes for
  2864  
  2865     Oth. By the World,
  2866  I thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not:
  2867  I thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not:
  2868  Ile haue some proofe. My name that was as fresh
  2869  As Dians Visage, is now begrim'd and blacke
  2870  As mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues,
  2871  Poyson, or Fire, or suffocating streames,
  2872  Ile not indure it. Would I were satisfied
  2873  
  2874     Iago. I see you are eaten vp with Passion:
  2875  I do repent me, that I put it to you.
  2876  You would be satisfied?
  2877    Oth. Would? Nay, and I will
  2878  
  2879     Iago. And may: but how? How satisfied, my Lord?
  2880  Would you the super-vision grossely gape on?
  2881  Behold her top'd?
  2882    Oth. Death, and damnation. Oh!
  2883    Iago. It were a tedious difficulty, I thinke,
  2884  To bring them to that Prospect: Damne them then,
  2885  If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster
  2886  More then their owne. What then? How then?
  2887  What shall I say? Where's Satisfaction?
  2888  It is impossible you should see this,
  2889  Were they as prime as Goates, as hot as Monkeyes,
  2890  As salt as Wolues in pride, and Fooles as grosse
  2891  As Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say,
  2892  If imputation, and strong circumstances,
  2893  Which leade directly to the doore of Truth,
  2894  Will giue you satisfaction, you might haue't
  2895  
  2896     Oth. Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall
  2897  
  2898     Iago. I do not like the Office.
  2899  But sith I am entred in this cause so farre
  2900  (Prick'd too't by foolish Honesty, and Loue)
  2901  I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,
  2902  And being troubled with a raging tooth,
  2903  I could not sleepe. There are a kinde of men,
  2904  So loose of Soule, that in their sleepes will mutter
  2905  Their Affayres: one of this kinde is Cassio:
  2906  In sleepe I heard him say, sweet Desdemona,
  2907  Let vs be wary, let vs hide our Loues,
  2908  And then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand:
  2909  Cry, oh sweet Creature: then kisse me hard,
  2910  As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes,
  2911  That grew vpon my lippes, laid his Leg ore my Thigh,
  2912  And sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate,
  2913  That gaue thee to the Moore
  2914  
  2915     Oth. O monstrous! monstrous!
  2916    Iago. Nay, this was but his Dreame
  2917  
  2918     Oth. But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion,
  2919  'Tis a shrew'd doubt, though it be but a Dreame
  2920  
  2921     Iago. And this may helpe to thicken other proofes,
  2922  That do demonstrate thinly
  2923  
  2924     Oth. Ile teare her all to peeces
  2925  
  2926     Iago. Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done,
  2927  She may be honest yet: Tell me but this,
  2928  Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe
  2929  Spotted with Strawberries, in your wiues hand?
  2930    Oth. I gaue her such a one: 'twas my first gift
  2931  
  2932     Iago. I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe
  2933  (I am sure it was your wiues) did I to day
  2934  See Cassio wipe his Beard with
  2935  
  2936     Oth. If it be that
  2937  
  2938     Iago. If it be that, or any, it was here.
  2939  It speakes against her with the other proofes
  2940  
  2941     Othel. O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues:
  2942  One is too poore, too weake for my reuenge.
  2943  Now do I see 'tis true. Looke heere Iago,
  2944  All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone.
  2945  Arise blacke vengeance, from the hollow hell,
  2946  Yeeld vp (O Loue) thy Crowne, and hearted Throne
  2947  To tyrannous Hate. Swell bosome with thy fraught,
  2948  For 'tis of Aspickes tongues
  2949  
  2950     Iago. Yet be content
  2951  
  2952     Oth. Oh blood, blood, blood
  2953  
  2954     Iago. Patience I say: your minde may change
  2955  
  2956     Oth. Neuer Iago. Like to the Ponticke Sea,
  2957  Whose Icie Current, and compulsiue course,
  2958  Neu'r keepes retyring ebbe, but keepes due on
  2959  To the Proponticke, and the Hellespont:
  2960  Euen so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace
  2961  Shall neu'r looke backe, neu'r ebbe to humble Loue,
  2962  Till that a capeable, and wide Reuenge
  2963  Swallow them vp. Now by yond Marble Heauen,
  2964  In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow,
  2965  I heere engage my words
  2966  
  2967     Iago. Do not rise yet:
  2968  Witnesse you euer-burning Lights aboue,
  2969  You Elements, that clip vs round about,
  2970  Witnesse that heere Iago doth giue vp
  2971  The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
  2972  To wrong'd Othello's Seruice. Let him command,
  2973  And to obey shall be in me remorse,
  2974  What bloody businesse euer
  2975  
  2976     Oth. I greet thy loue,
  2977  Not with vaine thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
  2978  And will vpon the instant put thee too't.
  2979  Within these three dayes let me heare thee say,
  2980  That Cassio's not aliue
  2981  
  2982     Iago. My Friend is dead:
  2983  'Tis done at your Request.
  2984  But let her liue
  2985  
  2986     Oth. Damne her lewde Minx:
  2987  O damne her, damne her.
  2988  Come go with me a-part, I will withdraw
  2989  To furnish me with some swift meanes of death
  2990  For the faire Diuell.
  2991  Now art thou my Lieutenant
  2992  
  2993     Iago. I am your owne for euer.
  2994  
  2995  Exeunt.
  2996  
  2997  
  2998  Scaena Quarta.
  2999  
  3000  Enter Desdemona, aemilia, and Clown.
  3001  
  3002    Des. Do you know Sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio
  3003  lyes?
  3004    Clow. I dare not say he lies any where
  3005  
  3006     Des. Why man?
  3007    Clo. He's a Soldier, and for me to say a Souldier lyes,
  3008  'tis stabbing
  3009  
  3010     Des. Go too: where lodges he?
  3011    Clo. To tell you where he lodges, is to tel you where
  3012  I lye
  3013  
  3014     Des. Can any thing be made of this?
  3015    Clo. I know not where he lodges, and for mee to deuise
  3016  a lodging, and say he lies heere, or he lies there, were
  3017  to lye in mine owne throat
  3018  
  3019     Des. Can you enquire him out? and be edified by report?
  3020    Clo. I will Catechize the world for him, that is, make
  3021  Questions, and by them answer
  3022  
  3023     Des. Seeke him, bidde him come hither: tell him, I
  3024  haue moou'd my Lord on his behalfe, and hope all will
  3025  be well
  3026  
  3027     Clo. To do this, is within the compasse of mans Wit,
  3028  and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
  3029  
  3030  Exit Clo.
  3031  
  3032    Des. Where should I loose the Handkerchiefe, aemilia?
  3033  Aemil. I know not Madam
  3034  
  3035     Des. Beleeue me, I had rather haue lost my purse
  3036  Full of Cruzadoes. And but my Noble Moore
  3037  Is true of minde, and made of no such basenesse,
  3038  As iealious Creatures are, it were enough
  3039  To put him to ill-thinking.
  3040  Aemil. Is he not iealious?
  3041    Des. Who, he? I thinke the Sun where he was borne,
  3042  Drew all such humors from him.
  3043  Aemil. Looke where he comes.
  3044  Enter Othello.
  3045  
  3046    Des. I will not leaue him now, till Cassio be
  3047  Call'd to him. How is't with you, my Lord?
  3048    Oth. Well my good Lady. Oh hardnes to dissemble!
  3049  How do you, Desdemona?
  3050    Des. Well, my good Lord
  3051  
  3052     Oth. Giue me your hand.
  3053  This hand is moist, my Lady
  3054  
  3055     Des. It hath felt no age, nor knowne no sorrow
  3056  
  3057     Oth. This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart:
  3058  Hot, hot, and moyst. This hand of yours requires
  3059  A sequester from Liberty: Fasting, and Prayer,
  3060  Much Castigation, Exercise deuout,
  3061  For heere's a yong, and sweating Diuell heere
  3062  That commonly rebels: 'Tis a good hand,
  3063  A franke one
  3064  
  3065     Des. You may (indeed) say so:
  3066  For 'twas that hand that gaue away my heart
  3067  
  3068     Oth. A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands:
  3069  But our new Heraldry is hands, not hearts
  3070  
  3071     Des. I cannot speake of this:
  3072  Come, now your promise
  3073  
  3074     Oth. What promise, Chucke?
  3075    Des. I haue sent to bid Cassio come speake with you
  3076  
  3077     Oth. I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me:
  3078  Lend me thy Handkerchiefe
  3079  
  3080     Des. Heere my Lord
  3081  
  3082     Oth. That which I gaue you
  3083  
  3084     Des. I haue it not about me
  3085  
  3086     Oth. Not?
  3087    Des. No indeed, my Lord
  3088  
  3089     Oth. That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe
  3090  Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue:
  3091  She was a Charmer, and could almost read
  3092  The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,
  3093  'T would make her Amiable, and subdue my Father
  3094  Intirely to her loue: But if she lost it,
  3095  Or made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye
  3096  Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt
  3097  After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,
  3098  And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd)
  3099  To giue it her. I did so; and take heede on't,
  3100  Make it a Darling, like your precious eye:
  3101  To loose't, or giue't away, were such perdition,
  3102  As nothing else could match
  3103  
  3104     Des. Is't possible?
  3105    Oth. 'Tis true: There's Magicke in the web of it:
  3106  A Sybill that had numbred in the world
  3107  The Sun to course, two hundred compasses,
  3108  In her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke:
  3109  The Wormes were hallowed, that did breede the Silke,
  3110  And it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull
  3111  Conseru'd of Maidens hearts
  3112  
  3113     Des. Indeed? Is't true?
  3114    Oth. Most veritable, therefore looke too't well
  3115  
  3116     Des. Then would to Heauen, that I had neuer seene't?
  3117    Oth. Ha? wherefore?
  3118    Des. Why do you speake so startingly, and rash?
  3119    Oth. Is't lost? Is't gon? Speak, is't out o'th' way?
  3120    Des. Blesse vs
  3121  
  3122     Oth. Say you?
  3123    Des. It is not lost: but what and if it were?
  3124    Oth. How?
  3125    Des. I say it is not lost
  3126  
  3127     Oth. Fetcht, let me see't
  3128  
  3129     Des. Why so I can: but I will not now:
  3130  This is a tricke to put me from my suite,
  3131  Pray you let Cassio be receiu'd againe
  3132  
  3133     Oth. Fetch me the Handkerchiefe,
  3134  My minde mis-giues
  3135  
  3136     Des. Come, come: you'l neuer meete a more sufficient
  3137  man
  3138  
  3139     Oth. The Handkerchiefe
  3140  
  3141     Des. A man that all his time
  3142  Hath founded his good Fortunes on your loue;
  3143  Shar'd dangers with you
  3144  
  3145     Oth. The Handkerchiefe
  3146  
  3147     Des. Insooth, you are too blame
  3148  
  3149     Oth. Away.
  3150  
  3151  Exit Othello.
  3152  
  3153  Aemil. Is not this man iealious?
  3154    Des. I neu'r saw this before.
  3155  Sure, there's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe,
  3156  I am most vnhappy in the losse of it.
  3157  Aemil. 'Tis not a yeare or two shewes vs a man:
  3158  They are all but Stomackes, and we all but Food,
  3159  They eate vs hungerly, and when they are full
  3160  They belch vs.
  3161  Enter Iago, and Cassio.
  3162  
  3163  Looke you, Cassio and my Husband
  3164  
  3165     Iago. There is no other way: 'tis she must doo't:
  3166  And loe the happinesse: go, and importune her
  3167  
  3168     Des. How now (good Cassio) what's the newes with
  3169  you?
  3170    Cassio. Madam, my former suite. I do beseech you,
  3171  That by your vertuous meanes, I may againe
  3172  Exist, and be a member of his loue,
  3173  Whom I, with all the Office of my heart
  3174  Intirely honour, I would not be delayd.
  3175  If my offence, be of such mortall kinde,
  3176  That nor my Seruice past, nor present Sorrowes,
  3177  Nor purpos'd merit in futurity,
  3178  Can ransome me into his loue againe,
  3179  But to know so, must be my benefit:
  3180  So shall I cloath me in a forc'd content,
  3181  And shut my selfe vp in some other course
  3182  To Fortunes Almes
  3183  
  3184     Des. Alas (thrice-gentle Cassio)
  3185  My Aduocation is not now in Tune;
  3186  My Lord, is not my Lord; nor should I know him,
  3187  Were he in Fauour, as in Humour alter'd.
  3188  So helpe me euery spirit sanctified,
  3189  As I haue spoken for you all my best,
  3190  And stood within the blanke of his displeasure
  3191  For my free speech. You must awhile be patient:
  3192  What I can do, I will: and more I will
  3193  Then for my selfe, I dare. Let that suffice you
  3194  
  3195     Iago. Is my Lord angry?
  3196  Aemil. He went hence but now:
  3197  And certainly in strange vnquietnesse
  3198  
  3199     Iago. Can he be angry? I haue seen the Cannon
  3200  When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre,
  3201  And like the Diuell from his very Arme
  3202  Puff't his owne Brother: And is he angry?
  3203  Something of moment then: I will go meet him,
  3204  There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.
  3205  
  3206  Exit
  3207  
  3208    Des. I prythee do so. Something sure of State,
  3209  Either from Venice, or some vnhatch'd practise
  3210  Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus, to him,
  3211  Hath pudled his cleare Spirit: and in such cases,
  3212  Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things,
  3213  Though great ones are their obiect. 'Tis euen so.
  3214  For let our finger ake, and it endues
  3215  Our other healthfull members, euen to a sense
  3216  Of paine. Nay, we must thinke men are not Gods,
  3217  Nor of them looke for such obseruancie
  3218  As fits the Bridall. Beshrew me much, aemilia,
  3219  I was (vnhandsome Warrior, as I am)
  3220  Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule:
  3221  But now I finde, I had suborn'd the Witnesse,
  3222  And he's Indited falsely.
  3223  Aemil. Pray heauen it bee
  3224  State matters, as you thinke, and no Conception,
  3225  Nor no Iealious Toy, concerning you
  3226  
  3227     Des. Alas the day, I neuer gaue him cause.
  3228  Aemil. But Iealious soules will not be answer'd so;
  3229  They are not euer iealious for the cause,
  3230  But iealious, for they're iealious. It is a Monster
  3231  Begot vpon it selfe, borne on it selfe
  3232  
  3233     Des. Heauen keepe the Monster from Othello's mind.
  3234  Aemil. Lady, Amen
  3235  
  3236     Des. I will go seeke him. Cassio, walke heere about:
  3237  If I doe finde him fit, Ile moue your suite,
  3238  And seeke to effect it to my vttermost.
  3239  
  3240  Exit
  3241  
  3242    Cas. I humbly thanke your Ladyship.
  3243  Enter Bianca.
  3244  
  3245    Bian. 'Saue you (Friend Cassio.)
  3246    Cassio. What make you from home?
  3247  How is't with you, my most faire Bianca?
  3248  Indeed (sweet Loue) I was comming to your house
  3249  
  3250     Bian. And I was going to your Lodging, Cassio.
  3251  What? keepe a weeke away? Seuen dayes, and Nights?
  3252  Eight score eight houres? And Louers absent howres
  3253  More tedious then the Diall, eight score times?
  3254  Oh weary reck'ning
  3255  
  3256     Cassio. Pardon me, Bianca:
  3257  I haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest,
  3258  But I shall in a more continuate time
  3259  Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca
  3260  Take me this worke out
  3261  
  3262     Bianca. Oh Cassio, whence came this?
  3263  This is some Token from a newer Friend,
  3264  To the felt-Absence: now I feele a Cause:
  3265  Is't come to this? Well, well
  3266  
  3267     Cassio. Go too, woman:
  3268  Throw your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth,
  3269  From whence you haue them. You are iealious now,
  3270  That this is from some Mistris, some remembrance;
  3271  No, in good troth Bianca
  3272  
  3273     Bian. Why, who's is it?
  3274    Cassio. I know not neither:
  3275  I found it in my Chamber,
  3276  I like the worke well; Ere it be demanded
  3277  (As like enough it will) I would haue it coppied:
  3278  Take it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time
  3279  
  3280     Bian. Leaue you? Wherefore?
  3281    Cassio. I do attend heere on the Generall,
  3282  And thinke it no addition, nor my wish
  3283  To haue him see me woman'd
  3284  
  3285     Bian. Why, I pray you?
  3286    Cassio. Not that I loue you not
  3287  
  3288     Bian. But that you do not loue me.
  3289  I pray you bring me on the way a little,
  3290  And say, if I shall see you soone at night?
  3291    Cassio. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
  3292  For I attend heere: But Ile see you soone
  3293  
  3294     Bian. 'Tis very good: I must be circumstanc'd.
  3295  
  3296  Exeunt. omnes.
  3297  
  3298  
  3299  Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.
  3300  
  3301  Enter Othello, and Iago.
  3302  
  3303    Iago. Will you thinke so?
  3304    Oth. Thinke so, Iago?
  3305    Iago. What, to kisse in priuate?
  3306    Oth. An vnauthoriz'd kisse?
  3307    Iago. Or to be naked with her Friend in bed,
  3308  An houre, or more, not meaning any harme?
  3309    Oth. Naked in bed (Iago) and not meane harme?
  3310  It is hypocrisie against the Diuell:
  3311  They that meane vertuously, and yet do so,
  3312  The Diuell their vertue tempts, and they tempt Heauen
  3313  
  3314     Iago. If they do nothing, 'tis a Veniall slip:
  3315  But if I giue my wife a Handkerchiefe
  3316  
  3317     Oth. What then?
  3318    Iago. Why then 'tis hers (my Lord) and being hers,
  3319  She may (I thinke) bestow't on any man
  3320  
  3321     Oth. She is Protectresse of her honor too:
  3322  May she giue that?
  3323    Iago. Her honor is an Essence that's not seene,
  3324  They haue it very oft, that haue it not.
  3325  But for the Handkerchiefe
  3326  
  3327     Othe. By heauen, I would most gladly haue forgot it:
  3328  Thou saidst (oh, it comes ore my memorie,
  3329  As doth the Rauen o're the infectious house:
  3330  Boading to all) he had my Handkerchiefe
  3331  
  3332     Iago . I: what of that?
  3333    Othe. That's not so good now
  3334  
  3335     Iag. What if I had said, I had seene him do you wrong?
  3336  Or heard him say (as Knaues be such abroad,
  3337  Who hauing by their owne importunate suit,
  3338  Or voluntary dotage of some Mistris,
  3339  Conuinced or supply'd them, cannot chuse
  3340  But they must blab.)
  3341    Oth. Hath he said any thing?
  3342    Iago. He hath (my Lord) but be you well assur'd,
  3343  No more then he'le vn-sweare
  3344  
  3345     Oth. What hath he said?
  3346    Iago. Why, that he did: I know not what he did
  3347  
  3348     Othe. What? What?
  3349    Iago. Lye
  3350  
  3351     Oth. With her?
  3352    Iago. With her? On her: what you will
  3353  
  3354     Othe. Lye with her? lye on her? We say lye on her,
  3355  when they be-lye-her. Lye with her: that's fullsome:
  3356  Handkerchiefe: Confessions: Handkerchiefe. To confesse,
  3357  and be hang'd for his labour. First, to be hang'd,
  3358  and then to confesse: I tremble at it. Nature would not
  3359  inuest her selfe in such shadowing passion, without some
  3360  Instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish)
  3361  Noses, Eares, and Lippes: is't possible. Confesse? Handkerchiefe?
  3362  O diuell.
  3363  
  3364  Falls in a Traunce.
  3365  
  3366    Iago. Worke on,
  3367  My Medicine workes. Thus credulous Fooles are caught,
  3368  And many worthy, and chast Dames euen thus,
  3369  (All guiltlesse) meete reproach: what hoa? My Lord?
  3370  My Lord, I say: Othello.
  3371  Enter Cassio.
  3372  
  3373  How now Cassio?
  3374    Cas. What's the matter?
  3375    Iago. My Lord is falne into an Epilepsie,
  3376  This is his second Fit: he had one yesterday
  3377  
  3378     Cas. Rub him about the Temples
  3379  
  3380     Iago. The Lethargie must haue his quyet course:
  3381  If not, he foames at mouth: and by and by
  3382  Breakes out to sauage madnesse. Looke, he stirres:
  3383  Do you withdraw your selfe a little while,
  3384  He will recouer straight: when he is gone,
  3385  I would on great occasion, speake with you.
  3386  How is it Generall? Haue you not hurt your head?
  3387    Othe. Dost thou mocke me?
  3388    Iago. I mocke you not, by Heauen:
  3389  Would you would beare your Fortune like a Man
  3390  
  3391     Othe. A Horned man's a Monster, and a Beast
  3392  
  3393     Iago. Ther's many a Beast then in a populous Citty,
  3394  And many a ciuill Monster
  3395  
  3396     Othe. Did he confesse it?
  3397    Iago. Good Sir, be a man:
  3398  Thinke euery bearded fellow that's but yoak'd
  3399  May draw with you. There's Millions now aliue,
  3400  That nightly lye in those vnproper beds,
  3401  Which they dare sweare peculiar. Your case is better.
  3402  Oh, 'tis the spight of hell, the Fiends Arch-mock,
  3403  To lip a wanton in a secure Cowch;
  3404  And to suppose her chast. No, let me know,
  3405  And knowing what I am, I know what she shallbe
  3406  
  3407     Oth. Oh, thou art wise: 'tis certaine
  3408  
  3409     Iago. Stand you a while apart,
  3410  Confine your selfe but in a patient List,
  3411  Whil'st you were heere, o're-whelmed with your griefe
  3412  (A passion most resulting such a man)
  3413  Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
  3414  And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie,
  3415  Bad him anon returne: and heere speake with me,
  3416  The which he promis'd. Do but encaue your selfe,
  3417  And marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes
  3418  That dwell in euery Region of his face.
  3419  For I will make him tell the Tale anew;
  3420  Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
  3421  He hath, and is againe to cope your wife.
  3422  I say, but marke his gesture: marry Patience,
  3423  Or I shall say y'are all in all in Spleene,
  3424  And nothing of a man
  3425  
  3426     Othe. Do'st thou heare, Iago,
  3427  I will be found most cunning in my Patience:
  3428  But (do'st thou heare) most bloody
  3429  
  3430     Iago. That's not amisse,
  3431  But yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw?
  3432  Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
  3433  A Huswife that by selling her desires
  3434  Buyes her selfe Bread, and Cloath. It is a Creature
  3435  That dotes on Cassio, (as 'tis the Strumpets plague
  3436  To be-guile many, and be be-guil'd by one)
  3437  He, when he heares of her, cannot restraine
  3438  From the excesse of Laughter. Heere he comes.
  3439  Enter Cassio.
  3440  
  3441  As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad:
  3442  And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue
  3443  Poore Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behauiours
  3444  Quite in the wrong. How do you Lieutenant?
  3445    Cas. The worser, that you giue me the addition,
  3446  Whose want euen killes me
  3447  
  3448     Iago. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't:
  3449  Now, if this Suit lay in Bianca's dowre,
  3450  How quickely should you speed?
  3451    Cas. Alas poore Caitiffe
  3452  
  3453     Oth. Looke how he laughes already
  3454  
  3455     Iago. I neuer knew woman loue man so
  3456  
  3457     Cas. Alas poore Rogue, I thinke indeed she loues me
  3458  
  3459     Oth. Now he denies it faintly: and laughes it out
  3460  
  3461     Iago. Do you heare Cassio?
  3462    Oth. Now he importunes him
  3463  To tell it o're: go too, well said, well said
  3464  
  3465     Iago. She giues it out, that you shall marry her.
  3466  Do you intend it?
  3467    Cas. Ha, ha, ha
  3468  
  3469     Oth. Do ye triumph, Romaine? do you triumph?
  3470    Cas. I marry. What? A customer; prythee beare
  3471  Some Charitie to my wit, do not thinke it
  3472  So vnwholesome. Ha, ha, ha
  3473  
  3474     Oth. So, so, so, so: they laugh, that winnes
  3475  
  3476     Iago. Why the cry goes, that you marry her
  3477  
  3478     Cas. Prythee say true
  3479  
  3480     Iago. I am a very Villaine else
  3481  
  3482     Oth. Haue you scoar'd me? Well
  3483  
  3484     Cas. This is the Monkeys owne giuing out:
  3485  She is perswaded I will marry her
  3486  Out of her owne loue & flattery, not out of my promise
  3487  
  3488     Oth. Iago becomes me: now he begins the story
  3489  
  3490     Cassio. She was heere euen now: she haunts me in euery
  3491  place. I was the other day talking on the Seabanke
  3492  with certaine Venetians, and thither comes the
  3493  Bauble, and falls me thus about my neck
  3494  
  3495     Oth. Crying oh deere Cassio, as it were: his iesture imports
  3496  it
  3497  
  3498     Cassio. So hangs, and lolls, and weepes vpon me:
  3499  So shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha
  3500  
  3501     Oth. Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber:
  3502  oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dogge, I
  3503  shall throw it to
  3504  
  3505     Cassio. Well, I must leaue her companie
  3506  
  3507     Iago. Before me: looke where she comes.
  3508  Enter Bianca.
  3509  
  3510    Cas. 'Tis such another Fitchew: marry a perfum'd one?
  3511  What do you meane by this haunting of me?
  3512    Bian. Let the diuell, and his dam haunt you: what
  3513  did you meane by that same Handkerchiefe, you gaue
  3514  me euen now? I was a fine Foole to take it: I must take
  3515  out the worke? A likely piece of worke, that you should
  3516  finde it in your Chamber, and know not who left it there.
  3517  This is some Minxes token, & I must take out the worke?
  3518  There, giue it your Hobbey-horse, wheresoeuer you had
  3519  it, Ile take out no worke on't
  3520  
  3521     Cassio. How now, my sweete Bianca?
  3522  How now? How now?
  3523    Othe. By Heauen, that should be my Handkerchiefe
  3524  
  3525     Bian. If you'le come to supper to night you may, if
  3526  you will not come when you are next prepar'd for.
  3527  
  3528  Exit
  3529  
  3530    Iago. After her: after her
  3531  
  3532     Cas. I must, shee'l rayle in the streets else
  3533  
  3534     Iago. Will you sup there?
  3535    Cassio. Yes, I intend so
  3536  
  3537     Iago. Well, I may chance to see you: for I would very
  3538  faine speake with you
  3539  
  3540     Cas. Prythee come: will you?
  3541    Iago. Go too; say no more
  3542  
  3543     Oth. How shall I murther him, Iago
  3544  
  3545     Iago. Did you perceiue how he laugh'd at his vice?
  3546    Oth. Oh, Iago
  3547  
  3548     Iago. And did you see the Handkerchiefe?
  3549    Oth. Was that mine?
  3550    Iago. Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes
  3551  the foolish woman your wife: she gaue it him and, he
  3552  hath giu'n it his whore
  3553  
  3554     Oth. I would haue him nine yeeres a killing:
  3555  A fine woman, a faire woman, a sweete woman?
  3556    Iago. Nay, you must forget that
  3557  
  3558     Othello. I, let her rot and perish, and be damn'd to
  3559  night, for she shall not liue. No, my heart is turn'd to
  3560  stone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand. Oh, the world
  3561  hath not a sweeter Creature: she might lye by an Emperours
  3562  side, and command him Taskes
  3563  
  3564     Iago. Nay, that's not your way
  3565  
  3566     Othe. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate
  3567  with her Needle: an admirable Musitian. Oh she will
  3568  sing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare: of so high and plenteous
  3569  wit, and inuention?
  3570    Iago. She's the worse for all this
  3571  
  3572     Othe. Oh, a thousand, a thousand times:
  3573  And then of so gentle a condition?
  3574    Iago. I too gentle
  3575  
  3576     Othe. Nay that's certaine:
  3577  But yet the pitty of it, Iago: oh Iago, the pitty of it
  3578  Iago
  3579  
  3580     Iago. If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her
  3581  pattent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes neere
  3582  no body
  3583  
  3584     Oth. I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me?
  3585    Iago. Oh, 'tis foule in her
  3586  
  3587     Oth. With mine Officer?
  3588    Iago. That's fouler
  3589  
  3590     Othe. Get me some poyson, Iago, this night. Ile not
  3591  expostulate with her: least her body and beautie vnprouide
  3592  my mind againe: this night Iago
  3593  
  3594     Iago. Do it not with poyson, strangle her in her bed,
  3595  Euen the bed she hath contaminated
  3596  
  3597     Oth. Good, good:
  3598  The Iustice of it pleases: very good
  3599  
  3600     Iago. And for Cassio, let me be his vndertaker:
  3601  You shall heare more by midnight.
  3602  Enter Lodouico, Desdemona, and Attendants.
  3603  
  3604    Othe. Excellent good: What Trumpet is that same?
  3605    Iago. I warrant something from Venice,
  3606  'Tis Lodouico, this, comes from the Duke.
  3607  See, your wife's with him
  3608  
  3609     Lodo. Saue you worthy Generall
  3610  
  3611     Othe. With all my heart Sir
  3612  
  3613     Lod. The Duke, and the Senators of Venice greet you
  3614  
  3615     Othe. I kisse the Instrument of their pleasures
  3616  
  3617     Des. And what's the newes, good cozen Lodouico
  3618    Iago. I am very glad to see you Signior:
  3619  Welcome to Cyprus
  3620  
  3621     Lod. I thanke you: how do's Lieutenant Cassio?
  3622    Iago. Liues Sir,
  3623    Des. Cozen, there's falne betweene him, & my Lord,
  3624  An vnkind breach: but you shall make all well
  3625  
  3626     Othe. Are you sure of that?
  3627    Des. My Lord?
  3628    Othe. This faile you not to do, as you will-
  3629    Lod. He did not call: he's busie in the paper,
  3630  Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and Cassio?
  3631    Des. A most vnhappy one: I would do much
  3632  T' attone, them, for the loue I beare to Cassio
  3633  
  3634     Oth. Fire, and brimestone
  3635  
  3636     Des. My Lord
  3637  
  3638     Oth. Are you wise?
  3639    Des. What is he angrie?
  3640    Lod. May be the Letter mou'd him.
  3641  For as I thinke, they do command him home,
  3642  Deputing Cassio in his Gouernment
  3643  
  3644     Des. Trust me, I am glad on't
  3645  
  3646     Othe. Indeed?
  3647    Des. My Lord?
  3648    Othe. I am glad to see you mad
  3649  
  3650     Des. Why, sweete Othello?
  3651    Othe. Diuell
  3652  
  3653     Des. I haue not deseru'd this
  3654  
  3655     Lod. My Lord, this would not be beleeu'd in Venice,
  3656  Though I should sweare I saw't. 'Tis very much,
  3657  Make her amends: she weepes
  3658  
  3659     Othe. Oh diuell, diuell:
  3660  If that the Earth could teeme with womans teares,
  3661  Each drop she falls, would proue a Crocodile:
  3662  Out of my sight
  3663  
  3664     Des. I will not stay to offend you
  3665  
  3666     Lod. Truely obedient Lady:
  3667  I do beseech your Lordship call her backe
  3668  
  3669     Othe. Mistris
  3670  
  3671     Des. My Lord
  3672  
  3673     Othe. What would you with her, Sir?
  3674    Lod. Who I, my Lord?
  3675    Othe. I, you did wish, that I would make her turne:
  3676  Sir, she can turne, and turne: and yet go on
  3677  And turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe.
  3678  And she's obedient: as you say obedient.
  3679  Very obedient: proceed you in your teares.
  3680  Concerning this Sir, (oh well-painted passion)
  3681  I am commanded home: get you away:
  3682  Ile send for you anon. Sir I obey the Mandate,
  3683  And will returne to Venice. Hence, auaunt:
  3684  Cassio shall haue my Place. And Sir, to night
  3685  I do entreat, that we may sup together.
  3686  You are welcome Sir to Cyprus.
  3687  Goates, and Monkeys.
  3688  Enter.
  3689  
  3690    Lod. Is this the Noble Moore, whom our full Senate
  3691  Call all in all sufficient? Is this the Nature
  3692  Whom Passion could not shake? Whose solid vertue
  3693  The shot of Accident, nor dart of Chance
  3694  Could neither graze, nor pierce?
  3695    Iago. He is much chang'd
  3696  
  3697     Lod. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of Braine?
  3698    Iago. He's that he is: I may not breath my censure.
  3699  What he might be: if what he might, he is not,
  3700  I would to heauen he were
  3701  
  3702     Lod. What? Strike his wife?
  3703    Iago. 'Faith that was not so well: yet would I knew
  3704  That stroke would proue the worst
  3705  
  3706     Lod. Is it his vse?
  3707  Or did the Letters, worke vpon his blood,
  3708  And new create his fault?
  3709    Iago. Alas, alas:
  3710  It is not honestie in me to speake
  3711  What I haue seene, and knowne. You shall obserue him,
  3712  And his owne courses will denote him so,
  3713  That I may saue my speech: do but go after
  3714  And marke how he continues
  3715  
  3716     Lod. I am sorry that I am deceiu'd in him.
  3717  
  3718  Exeunt.
  3719  
  3720  
  3721  Scena Secunda.
  3722  
  3723  Enter Othello and aemilia.
  3724  
  3725    Othe. You haue seene nothing then?
  3726  Aemil. Nor euer heard: nor euer did suspect
  3727  
  3728     Othe. Yes, you haue seene Cassio, and she together
  3729  
  3730     Aemi. But then I saw no harme: and then I heard,
  3731  Each syllable that breath made vp betweene them
  3732  
  3733     Othe. What? Did they neuer whisper?
  3734  Aemil. Neuer my Lord
  3735  
  3736     Othe. Nor send you out o'th' way?
  3737  Aemil. Neuer
  3738  
  3739     Othe. To fetch her Fan, her Gloues, her Mask, nor nothing?
  3740  Aemil. Neuer my Lord
  3741  
  3742     Othe. That's strange.
  3743  Aemil. I durst (my Lord) to wager, she is honest:
  3744  Lay downe my Soule at stake: If you thinke other,
  3745  Remoue your thought. It doth abuse your bosome:
  3746  If any wretch haue put this in your head,
  3747  Let Heauen requit it with the Serpents curse,
  3748  For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
  3749  There's no man happy. The purest of their Wiues
  3750  Is foule as Slander
  3751  
  3752     Othe. Bid her come hither: go.
  3753  
  3754  Exit aemilia.
  3755  
  3756  She saies enough: yet she's a simple Baud
  3757  That cannot say as much. This is a subtile Whore:
  3758  A Closset Locke and Key of Villanous Secrets,
  3759  And yet she'le kneele, and pray: I haue seene her do't.
  3760  Enter Desdemona, and aemilia.
  3761  
  3762    Des. My Lord, what is your will?
  3763    Othe. Pray you Chucke come hither
  3764  
  3765     Des. What is your pleasure?
  3766    Oth. Let me see your eyes: looke in my face
  3767  
  3768     Des. What horrible Fancie's this?
  3769    Othe. Some of your Function Mistris:
  3770  Leaue Procreants alone, and shut the doore:
  3771  Cough, or cry hem; if any body come:
  3772  Your Mystery, your Mystery: May dispatch.
  3773  
  3774  Exit aemi.
  3775  
  3776    Des. Vpon my knee, what doth your speech import?
  3777  I vnderstand a Fury in your words
  3778  
  3779     Othe. Why? What art thou?
  3780    Des. Your wife my Lord: your true and loyall wife
  3781  
  3782     Othello. Come sweare it: damne thy selfe, least
  3783  being like one of Heauen, the diuells themselues should
  3784  feare to ceaze thee. Therefore be double damn'd: sweare
  3785  thou art honest
  3786  
  3787     Des. Heauen doth truely know it
  3788  
  3789     Othe. Heauen truely knowes, that thou art false as hell
  3790  
  3791     Des. To whom my Lord?
  3792  With whom? How am I false?
  3793    Othe. Ah Desdemon, away, away, away
  3794  
  3795     Des. Alas the heauy day: why do you weepe?
  3796  Am I the motiue of these teares my Lord?
  3797  If happely you my Father do suspect,
  3798  An Instrument of this your calling backe,
  3799  Lay not your blame on me: if you haue lost him,
  3800  I haue lost him too
  3801  
  3802     Othe. Had it pleas'd Heauen,
  3803  To try me with Affliction, had they rain'd
  3804  All kind of Sores, and Shames on my bare-head:
  3805  Steep'd me in pouertie to the very lippes.
  3806  Giuen to Captiuitie, me, and my vtmost hopes,
  3807  I should haue found in some place of my Soule
  3808  A drop of patience. But alas, to make me
  3809  The fixed Figure for the time of Scorne,
  3810  To point his slow, and mouing finger at.
  3811  Yet could I beare that too, well, very well:
  3812  But there where I haue garnerd vp my heart,
  3813  Where either I must liue, or beare no life,
  3814  The Fountaine from the which my currant runnes,
  3815  Or else dries vp: to be discarded thence,
  3816  Or keepe it as a Cesterne, for foule Toades
  3817  To knot and gender in. Turne thy complexion there:
  3818  Patience, thou young and Rose-lip'd Cherubin,
  3819  I heere looke grim as hell
  3820  
  3821     Des. I hope my Noble Lord esteemes me honest
  3822  
  3823     Othe. Oh I, as Sommer Flyes are in the Shambles,
  3824  That quicken euen with blowing. Oh thou weed:
  3825  Who art so louely faire, and smell'st so sweete,
  3826  That the Sense akes at thee,
  3827  Would thou had'st neuer bin borne
  3828  
  3829     Des. Alas, what ignorant sin haue I committed?
  3830    Othe. Was this faire Paper? This most goodly Booke
  3831  Made to write Whore vpon? What commited,
  3832  Committed? Oh, thou publicke Commoner,
  3833  I should make very Forges of my cheekes,
  3834  That would to Cynders burne vp Modestie,
  3835  Did I but speake thy deedes. What commited?
  3836  Heauen stoppes the Nose at it, and the Moone winks:
  3837  The baudy winde that kisses all it meetes,
  3838  Is hush'd within the hollow Myne of Earth
  3839  And will not hear't. What commited?
  3840    Des. By Heauen you do me wrong
  3841  
  3842     Othe. Are not you a Strumpet?
  3843    Des. No, as I am a Christian.
  3844  If to preserue this vessell for my Lord,
  3845  From any other foule vnlawfull touch
  3846  Be not to be a Strumpet, I am none
  3847  
  3848     Othe. What, not a Whore?
  3849    Des. No, as I shall be sau'd
  3850  
  3851     Othe. Is't possible?
  3852    Des. Oh Heauen forgiue vs
  3853  
  3854     Othe. I cry you mercy then.
  3855  I tooke you for that cunning Whore of Venice,
  3856  That married with Othello. You Mistris,
  3857  Enter aemilia.
  3858  
  3859  That haue the office opposite to Saint Peter,
  3860  And keepes the gate of hell. You, you: I you.
  3861  We haue done our course: there's money for your paines:
  3862  I pray you turne the key, and keepe our counsaile.
  3863  Enter.
  3864  
  3865  Aemil. Alas, what do's this Gentleman conceiue?
  3866  How do you Madam? how do you my good Lady?
  3867    Des. Faith, halfe a sleepe
  3868  
  3869     Aemi. Good Madam,
  3870  What's the matter with my Lord?
  3871    Des. With who?
  3872  Aemil. Why, with my Lord, Madam?
  3873    Des. Who is thy Lord?
  3874  Aemil. He that is yours, sweet Lady
  3875  
  3876     Des. I haue none: do not talke to me, aemilia,
  3877  I cannot weepe: nor answeres haue I none,
  3878  But what should go by water. Prythee to night,
  3879  Lay on my bed my wedding sheetes, remember,
  3880  And call thy husband hither.
  3881  Aemil. Heere's a change indeed.
  3882  Enter.
  3883  
  3884    Des. 'Tis meete I should be vs'd so: very meete.
  3885  How haue I bin behau'd, that he might sticke
  3886  The small'st opinion on my least misvse?
  3887  Enter Iago, and aemilia.
  3888  
  3889    Iago. What is your pleasure Madam?
  3890  How is't with you?
  3891    Des. I cannot tell: those that do teach yong Babes
  3892  Do it with gentle meanes, and easie taskes.
  3893  He might haue chid me so; for in good faith
  3894  I am a Child to chiding
  3895  
  3896     Iago. What is the matter Lady?
  3897  Aemil. Alas (Iago) my Lord hath so bewhor'd her,
  3898  Throwne such dispight, and heauy termes vpon her
  3899  That true hearts cannot beare it
  3900  
  3901     Des. Am I that name, Iago?
  3902    Iago. What name, (faire Lady?)
  3903    Des. Such as she said my Lord did say I was.
  3904  Aemil. He call'd her whore: a Begger in his drinke:
  3905  Could not haue laid such termes vpon his Callet
  3906  
  3907     Iago. Why did he so?
  3908    Des. I do not know: I am sure I am none such
  3909  
  3910     Iago. Do not weepe, do not weepe: alas the day.
  3911  Aemil. Hath she forsooke so many Noble Matches?
  3912  Her Father? And her Country? And her Friends?
  3913  To be call'd Whore? Would it not make one weepe?
  3914    Des. It is my wretched Fortune
  3915  
  3916     Iago. Beshrew him for't:
  3917  How comes this Tricke vpon him?
  3918    Des. Nay, Heauen doth know
  3919  
  3920     Aemi. I will be hang'd, if some eternall Villaine,
  3921  Some busie and insinuating Rogue,
  3922  Some cogging, cozening Slaue, to get some Office,
  3923  Haue not deuis'd this Slander: I will be hang'd else
  3924  
  3925     Iago. Fie, there is no such man: it is impossible
  3926  
  3927     Des. If any such there be, Heauen pardon him.
  3928  Aemil. A halter pardon him:
  3929  And hell gnaw his bones.
  3930  Why should he call her Whore?
  3931  Who keepes her companie?
  3932  What Place? What Time?
  3933  What Forme? What liklyhood?
  3934  The Moore's abus'd by some most villanous Knaue,
  3935  Some base notorious Knaue, some scuruy Fellow.
  3936  Oh Heauens, that such companions thou'd'st vnfold,
  3937  And put in euery honest hand a whip
  3938  To lash the Rascalls naked through the world,
  3939  Euen from the East to th' West
  3940  
  3941     Iago. Speake within doore.
  3942  Aemil. Oh fie vpon them: some such Squire he was
  3943  That turn'd your wit, the seamy-side without,
  3944  And made you to suspect me with the Moore
  3945  
  3946     Iago. You are a Foole: go too
  3947  
  3948     Des. Alas Iago,
  3949  What shall I do to win my Lord againe?
  3950  Good Friend, go to him: for by this light of Heauen,
  3951  I know not how I lost him. Heere I kneele:
  3952  If ere my will did trespasse 'gainst his Loue,
  3953  Either in discourse of thought, or actuall deed,
  3954  Or that mine Eyes, mine Eares, or any Sence
  3955  Delighted them: or any other Forme.
  3956  Or that I do not yet, and euer did,
  3957  And euer will, (though he do shake me off
  3958  To beggerly diuorcement) Loue him deerely,
  3959  Comfort forsweare me. Vnkindnesse may do much,
  3960  And his vnkindnesse may defeat my life,
  3961  But neuer taynt my Loue. I cannot say Whore,
  3962  It do's abhorre me now I speake the word,
  3963  To do the Act, that might the addition earne,
  3964  Not the worlds Masse of vanitie could make me
  3965  
  3966     Iago. I pray you be content: 'tis but his humour:
  3967  The businesse of the State do's him offence
  3968  
  3969     Des. If 'twere no other
  3970  
  3971     Iago. It is but so, I warrant,
  3972  Hearke how these Instruments summon to supper:
  3973  The Messengers of Venice staies the meate,
  3974  Go in, and weepe not: all things shall be well.
  3975  
  3976  Exeunt. Desdemona and aemilia.
  3977  
  3978  Enter Rodorigo.
  3979  
  3980  How now Rodorigo?
  3981    Rod. I do not finde
  3982  That thou deal'st iustly with me
  3983  
  3984     Iago. What in the contrarie?
  3985    Rodori. Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise
  3986  Iago, and rather, as it seemes to me now, keep'st from
  3987  me all conueniencie, then suppliest me with the least aduantage
  3988  of hope: I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor
  3989  am I yet perswaded to put vp in peace, what already I
  3990  haue foolishly suffred
  3991  
  3992     Iago. Will you heare me Rodorigo?
  3993    Rodori. I haue heard too much: and your words and
  3994  Performances are no kin together
  3995  
  3996     Iago. You charge me most vniustly
  3997  
  3998     Rodo. With naught but truth: I haue wasted my
  3999  selfe out of my meanes. The Iewels you haue had from
  4000  me to deliuer Desdemona, would halfe haue corrupted a
  4001  Votarist. You haue told me she hath receiu'd them,
  4002  and return'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine
  4003  respect, and acquaintance, but I finde none
  4004  
  4005     Iago. Well, go too: very well
  4006  
  4007     Rod. Very well, go too: I cannot go too, (man) nor
  4008  'tis not very well. Nay I think it is scuruy: and begin to
  4009  finde my selfe fopt in it
  4010  
  4011     Iago. Very well
  4012  
  4013     Rodor. I tell you, 'tis not very well: I will make my
  4014  selfe knowne to Desdemona. If she will returne me my
  4015  Iewels, I will giue ouer my Suit, and repent my vnlawfull
  4016  solicitation. If not, assure your selfe, I will seeke
  4017  satisfaction of you
  4018  
  4019     Iago. You haue said now
  4020  
  4021     Rodo. I: and said nothing but what I protest intendment
  4022  of doing
  4023  
  4024     Iago. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and
  4025  euen from this instant do build on thee a better opinion
  4026  then euer before: giue me thy hand Rodorigo.
  4027  Thou hast taken against me a most iust exception:
  4028  but yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy
  4029  Affaire
  4030  
  4031     Rod. It hath not appeer'd
  4032  
  4033     Iago. I grant indeed it hath not appeer'd: and
  4034  your suspition is not without wit and iudgement.
  4035  But Rodorigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which
  4036  I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I
  4037  meane purpose, Courage, and Valour) this night
  4038  shew it. If thou the next night following enioy not
  4039  Desdemona, take me from this world with Treacherie,
  4040  and deuise Engines for my life
  4041  
  4042     Rod. Well: what is it? Is it within, reason and compasse?
  4043    Iago. Sir, there is especiall Commission come from
  4044  Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place
  4045  
  4046     Rod. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona
  4047  returne againe to Venice
  4048  
  4049     Iago. Oh no: he goes into Mauritania and taketh
  4050  away with him the faire Desdemona, vnlesse his abode
  4051  be lingred heere by some accident. Wherein
  4052  none can be so determinate, as the remouing of
  4053  Cassio
  4054  
  4055     Rod. How do you meane remouing him?
  4056    Iago. Why, by making him vncapable of Othello's
  4057  place: knocking out his braines
  4058  
  4059     Rod. And that you would haue me to do
  4060  
  4061     Iago. I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a
  4062  right. He sups to night with a Harlotry: and thither
  4063  will I go to him. He knowes not yet of his Honourable
  4064  Fortune, if you will watch his going thence (which
  4065  I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one)
  4066  you may take him at your pleasure. I will be neere
  4067  to second your Attempt, and he shall fall betweene
  4068  vs. Come, stand not amaz'd at it, but go along with
  4069  me: I will shew you such a necessitie in his death, that
  4070  you shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him. It
  4071  is now high supper time: and the night growes to wast.
  4072  About it
  4073  
  4074     Rod. I will heare further reason for this
  4075  
  4076     Iago. And you shalbe satisfi'd.
  4077  
  4078  Exeunt.
  4079  
  4080  
  4081  Scena Tertia.
  4082  
  4083  Enter Othello, Lodouico, Desdemona, aemilia, and Atendants.
  4084  
  4085    Lod. I do beseech you Sir, trouble your selfe no further
  4086  
  4087     Oth. Oh pardon me: 'twill do me good to walke
  4088  
  4089     Lodoui. Madam, good night: I humbly thanke your
  4090  Ladyship
  4091  
  4092     Des. Your Honour is most welcome
  4093  
  4094     Oth. Will you walke Sir? Oh Desdemona
  4095  
  4096     Des. My Lord
  4097  
  4098     Othello. Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be return'd
  4099  forthwith: dismisse your Attendant there: look't
  4100  be done.
  4101  Enter.
  4102  
  4103    Des. I will my Lord
  4104  
  4105     Aem. How goes it now? He lookes gentler then he did
  4106  
  4107     Des. He saies he will returne incontinent,
  4108  And hath commanded me to go to bed,
  4109  And bid me to dismisse you
  4110  
  4111     Aemi. Dismisse me?
  4112    Des. It was his bidding: therefore good aemilia,
  4113  Giue me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
  4114  We must not now displease him.
  4115  Aemil. I, would you had neuer seene him
  4116  
  4117     Des. So would not I: my loue doth so approue him,
  4118  That euen his stubbornesse, his checks, his frownes,
  4119  (Prythee vn-pin me) haue grace and fauour
  4120  
  4121     Aemi. I haue laid those Sheetes you bad me on the bed
  4122  
  4123     Des. All's one: good Father, how foolish are our minds?
  4124  If I do die before, prythee shrow'd me
  4125  In one of these same Sheetes.
  4126  Aemil. Come, come: you talke
  4127  
  4128     Des. My Mother had a Maid call'd Barbarie,
  4129  She was in loue: and he she lou'd prou'd mad,
  4130  And did forsake her. She had a Song of Willough,
  4131  An old thing 'twas: but it express'd her Fortune,
  4132  And she dy'd singing it. That Song to night,
  4133  Will not go from my mind: I haue much to do,
  4134  But to go hang my head all at one side
  4135  And sing it like poore Barbarie: prythee dispatch
  4136  
  4137     Aemi. Shall I go fetch your Night-gowne?
  4138    Des. No, vn-pin me here,
  4139  This Lodouico is a proper man.
  4140  Aemil. A very handsome man
  4141  
  4142     Des. He speakes well.
  4143  Aemil. I know a Lady in Venice would haue walk'd
  4144  barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip
  4145  
  4146     Des. The poore Soule sat singing, by a Sicamour tree.
  4147  Sing all a greene Willough:
  4148  Her hand on her bosome her head on her knee,
  4149  Sing Willough, Willough, Willough.
  4150  The fresh Streames ran by her, and murmur'd her moanes
  4151  Sing Willough, &c.
  4152  Her salt teares fell from her, and softned the stones,
  4153  Sing Willough, &c. (Lay by these)
  4154  Willough, Willough. (Prythee high thee: he'le come anon)
  4155  Sing all a greene Willough must be my Garland.
  4156  Let no body blame him, his scorne I approue.
  4157  (Nay that's not next. Harke, who is't that knocks?
  4158  Aemil. It's the wind
  4159  
  4160     Des. I call'd my Loue false Loue: but what said he then?
  4161  Sing Willough, &c.
  4162  If I court mo women, you'le couch with mo men.
  4163  So get thee gone, good night: mine eyes do itch:
  4164  Doth that boade weeping?
  4165  Aemil. 'Tis neyther heere, nor there
  4166  
  4167     Des. I haue heard it said so. O these Men, these men!
  4168  Do'st thou in conscience thinke (tell me aemilia)
  4169  That there be women do abuse their husbands
  4170  In such grosse kinde?
  4171  Aemil. There be some such, no question
  4172  
  4173     Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for all the world?
  4174  Aemil. Why, would not you?
  4175    Des. No, by this Heauenly light.
  4176  Aemil. Nor I neither, by this Heauenly light:
  4177  I might doo't as well i'th' darke
  4178  
  4179     Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world?
  4180  Aemil. The world's a huge thing:
  4181  It is a great price, for a small vice
  4182  
  4183     Des. Introth, I thinke thou would'st not.
  4184  Aemil. Introth I thinke I should, and vndoo't when
  4185  I had done. Marry, I would not doe such a thing for a
  4186  ioynt Ring, nor for measures of Lawne, nor for Gownes,
  4187  Petticoats, nor Caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for
  4188  all the whole world: why, who would not make her husband
  4189  a Cuckold, to make him a Monarch? I should venture
  4190  Purgatory for't
  4191  
  4192     Des. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  4193  For the whole world.
  4194  Aemil. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i'th' world;
  4195  and hauing the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in
  4196  your owne world, and you might quickly make it right
  4197  
  4198     Des. I do not thinke there is any such woman.
  4199  Aemil. Yes, a dozen: and as many to'th' vantage, as
  4200  would store the world they plaid for.
  4201  But I do thinke it is their Husbands faults
  4202  If Wiues do fall: (Say, that they slacke their duties,
  4203  And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps;
  4204  Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies,
  4205  Throwing restraint vpon vs: Or say they strike vs,
  4206  Or scant our former hauing in despight)
  4207  Why we haue galles: and though we haue some Grace,
  4208  Yet haue we some Reuenge. Let Husbands know,
  4209  Their wiues haue sense like them: They see, and smell,
  4210  And haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre,
  4211  As Husbands haue. What is it that they do,
  4212  When they change vs for others? Is it Sport?
  4213  I thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it?
  4214  I thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres?
  4215  It is so too. And haue not we Affections?
  4216  Desires for Sport? and Frailty, as men haue?
  4217  Then let them vse vs well: else let them know,
  4218  The illes we do, their illes instruct vs so
  4219  
  4220     Des. Good night, good night:
  4221  Heauen me such vses send,
  4222  Not to picke bad, from bad; but by bad, mend.
  4223  
  4224  Exeunt.
  4225  
  4226  Actus Quintus. Scena Prima.
  4227  
  4228  Enter Iago, and Rodorigo.
  4229  
  4230    Iago. Heere, stand behinde this Barke,
  4231  Straight will he come:
  4232  Weare thy good Rapier bare, and put it home:
  4233  Quicke, quicke, feare nothing; Ile be at thy Elbow,
  4234  It makes vs, or it marres vs, thinke on that,
  4235  And fixe most firme thy Resolution
  4236  
  4237     Rod. Be neere at hand, I may miscarry in't
  4238  
  4239     Iago. Heere, at thy hand: Be bold, & take thy stand
  4240  
  4241     Rod. I haue no great deuotion to the deed,
  4242  And yet he hath giuen me satisfying Reasons:
  4243  'Tis but a man gone. Forth my Sword: he dies
  4244  
  4245     Iago. I haue rub'd this yong Quat almost to the sense,
  4246  And he growes angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
  4247  Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
  4248  Euery way makes my gaine. Liue Rodorigo,
  4249  He calles me to a restitution large
  4250  Of Gold, and Iewels, that I bob'd from him,
  4251  As Guifts to Desdemona.
  4252  It must not be: If Cassio do remaine,
  4253  He hath a dayly beauty in his life,
  4254  That makes me vgly: and besides, the Moore
  4255  May vnfold me to him: there stand I in much perill:
  4256  No, he must dye. But so, I heard him comming.
  4257  Enter Cassio.
  4258  
  4259    Rod. I know his gate, 'tis he: Villaine thou dyest
  4260  
  4261     Cas. That thrust had beene mine enemy indeed,
  4262  But that my Coate is better then thou know'st:
  4263  I will make proofe of thine
  4264  
  4265     Rod. Oh, I am slaine
  4266  
  4267     Cassio. I am maym'd for euer:
  4268  Helpe hoa: Murther, murther.
  4269  Enter Othello.
  4270  
  4271    Oth. The voyce of Cassio. Iago keepes his word
  4272  
  4273     Rod. O Villaine that I am
  4274  
  4275     Oth. It is euen so
  4276  
  4277     Cas. Oh helpe hoa: Light, a Surgeon
  4278  
  4279     Oth. 'Tis he: O braue Iago, honest, and iust,
  4280  That hast such Noble sense of thy Friends wrong,
  4281  Thou teachest me. Minion, your deere lyes dead,
  4282  And your vnblest Fate highes: Strumpet I come:
  4283  For of my heart, those Charmes thine Eyes, are blotted.
  4284  Thy Bed lust-stain'd, shall with Lusts blood bee spotted.
  4285  
  4286  Exit Othello.
  4287  
  4288  Enter Lodouico and Gratiano.
  4289  
  4290    Cas. What hoa? no Watch? No passage?
  4291  Murther, Murther
  4292  
  4293     Gra. 'Tis some mischance, the voyce is very direfull
  4294  
  4295     Cas. Oh helpe
  4296  
  4297     Lodo. Hearke
  4298  
  4299     Rod. Oh wretched Villaine
  4300  
  4301     Lod. Two or three groane. 'Tis heauy night;
  4302  These may be counterfeits: Let's think't vnsafe
  4303  To come into the cry, without more helpe
  4304  
  4305     Rod. Nobody come: then shall I bleed to death.
  4306  Enter Iago.
  4307  
  4308    Lod. Hearke
  4309  
  4310     Gra. Here's one comes in his shirt, with Light, and
  4311  Weapons
  4312  
  4313     Iago. Who's there?
  4314  Who's noyse is this that cries on murther?
  4315    Lodo. We do not know
  4316  
  4317     Iago. Do not you heare a cry?
  4318    Cas. Heere, heere: for heauen sake helpe me
  4319  
  4320     Iago. What's the matter?
  4321    Gra. This is Othello's Ancient, as I take it
  4322  
  4323     Lodo. The same indeede, a very valiant Fellow
  4324  
  4325     Iago. What are you heere, that cry so greeuously?
  4326    Cas. Iago? Oh I am spoyl'd, vndone by Villaines:
  4327  Giue me some helpe
  4328  
  4329     Iago. O mee, Lieutenant!
  4330  What Villaines haue done this?
  4331    Cas. I thinke that one of them is heereabout.
  4332  And cannot make away
  4333  
  4334     Iago. Oh treacherous Villaines:
  4335  What are you there? Come in, and giue some helpe
  4336  
  4337     Rod. O helpe me there
  4338  
  4339     Cassio. That's one of them
  4340  
  4341     Iago. Oh murd'rous Slaue! O Villaine!
  4342    Rod. O damn'd Iago! O inhumane Dogge!
  4343    Iago. Kill men i'th' darke?
  4344  Where be these bloody Theeues?
  4345  How silent is this Towne? Hoa, murther, murther.
  4346  What may you be? Are you of good, or euill?
  4347    Lod. As you shall proue vs, praise vs
  4348  
  4349     Iago. Signior Lodouico?
  4350    Lod. He Sir
  4351  
  4352     Iago. I cry you mercy: here's Cassio hurt by Villaines
  4353  
  4354     Gra. Cassio?
  4355    Iago. How is't Brother?
  4356    Cas. My Legge is cut in two
  4357  
  4358     Iago. Marry heauen forbid:
  4359  Light Gentlemen, Ile binde it with my shirt.
  4360  Enter Bianca.
  4361  
  4362    Bian. What is the matter hoa? Who is't that cry'd?
  4363    Iago. Who is't that cry'd?
  4364    Bian. Oh my deere Cassio,
  4365  My sweet Cassio: Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio
  4366  
  4367     Iago. O notable Strumpet. Cassio, may you suspect
  4368  Who they should be, that haue thus mangled you?
  4369    Cas. No
  4370  
  4371     Gra. I am sorry to finde you thus;
  4372  I haue beene to seeke you
  4373  
  4374     Iago. Lend me a Garter. So: - Oh for a Chaire
  4375  To beare him easily hence
  4376  
  4377     Bian. Alas he faints. Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio
  4378  
  4379     Iago. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this Trash
  4380  To be a party in this Iniurie.
  4381  Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
  4382  Lend me a Light: know we this face, or no?
  4383  Alas my Friend, and my deere Countryman
  4384  Rodorigo? No: Yes sure: Yes, 'tis Rodorigo
  4385  
  4386     Gra. What, of Venice?
  4387    Iago. Euen he Sir: Did you know him?
  4388    Gra. Know him? I
  4389  
  4390     Iago. Signior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon:
  4391  These bloody accidents must excuse my Manners,
  4392  That so neglected you
  4393  
  4394     Gra. I am glad to see you
  4395  
  4396     Iago. How do you Cassio? Oh, a Chaire, a Chaire
  4397  
  4398     Gra. Rodorigo?
  4399    Iago. He, he, 'tis he:
  4400  Oh that's well said, the Chaire.
  4401  Some good man beare him carefully from hence,
  4402  Ile fetch the Generall's Surgeon. For you Mistris,
  4403  Saue you your labour. He that lies slaine heere (Cassio)
  4404  Was my deere friend. What malice was between you
  4405  
  4406     Cas. None in the world: nor do I know the man?
  4407    Iago. What? looke you pale? Oh beare him o'th' Ayre.
  4408  Stay you good Gentlemen. Looke you pale, Mistris?
  4409  Do you perceiue the gastnesse of her eye?
  4410  Nay, if you stare, we shall heare more anon.
  4411  Behold her well: I pray you looke vpon her:
  4412  Do you see Gentlemen? Nay, guiltinesse will speake
  4413  Though tongues were out of vse.
  4414  Aemil. Alas, what is the matter?
  4415  What is the matter, Husband?
  4416    Iago. Cassio hath heere bin set on in the darke
  4417  By Rodorigo, and Fellowes that are scap'd:
  4418  He's almost slaine, and Rodorigo quite dead.
  4419  Aemil. Alas good Gentleman: alas good Cassio
  4420  
  4421     Iago. This is the fruits of whoring. Prythe aemilia,
  4422  Go know of Cassio where he supt to night.
  4423  What, do you shake at that?
  4424    Bian. He supt at my house, but I therefore shake not
  4425  
  4426     Iago. O did he so? I charge you go with me.
  4427  Aemil. Oh fie vpon thee Strumpet
  4428  
  4429     Bian. I am no Strumpet, but of life as honest,
  4430  As you that thus abuse me.
  4431  Aemil. As I? Fie vpon thee
  4432  
  4433     Iago. Kinde Gentlemen:
  4434  Let's go see poore Cassio drest.
  4435  Come Mistris, you must tel's another Tale.
  4436  aemilia, run you to the Cittadell,
  4437  And tell my Lord and Lady, what hath happ'd:
  4438  Will you go on afore? This is the night
  4439  That either makes me, or foredoes me quight.
  4440  
  4441  Exeunt.
  4442  
  4443  Scoena Secunda.
  4444  
  4445  Enter Othello, and Desdemona in her bed.
  4446  
  4447    Oth. It is the Cause, it is the Cause (my Soule)
  4448  Let me not name it to you, you chaste Starres,
  4449  It is the Cause. Yet Ile not shed her blood,
  4450  Nor scarre that whiter skin of hers, then Snow,
  4451  And smooth as Monumentall Alablaster:
  4452  Yet she must dye, else shee'l betray more men:
  4453  Put out the Light, and then put out the Light:
  4454  If I quench thee, thou flaming Minister,
  4455  I can againe thy former light restore,
  4456  Should I repent me. But once put out thy Light,
  4457  Thou cunning'st Patterne of excelling Nature,
  4458  I know not where is that Promethaean heate
  4459  That can thy Light re-Lume.
  4460  When I haue pluck'd thy Rose,
  4461  I cannot giue it vitall growth againe,
  4462  It needs must wither. Ile smell thee on the Tree.
  4463  Oh Balmy breath, that dost almost perswade
  4464  Iustice to breake her Sword. One more, one more:
  4465  Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
  4466  And loue thee after. One more, and that's the last.
  4467  So sweet, was ne're so fatall. I must weepe,
  4468  But they are cruell Teares: This sorrow's heauenly,
  4469  It strikes, where it doth loue. She wakes
  4470  
  4471     Des. Who's there? Othello?
  4472    Othel. I Desdemona
  4473  
  4474     Des. Will you come to bed, my Lord?
  4475    Oth. Haue you pray'd to night, Desdemon?
  4476    Des. I my Lord
  4477  
  4478     Oth. If you bethinke your selfe of any Crime
  4479  Vnreconcil'd as yet to Heauen, and Grace,
  4480  Solicite for it straight
  4481  
  4482     Des. Alacke, my Lord,
  4483  What may you meane by that?
  4484    Oth. Well, do it, and be breefe, I will walke by:
  4485  I would not kill thy vnprepared Spirit,
  4486  No, Heauens fore-fend) I would not kill thy Soule
  4487  
  4488     Des. Talke you of killing?
  4489    Oth. I, I do
  4490  
  4491     Des. Then Heauen haue mercy on mee
  4492  
  4493     Oth. Amen, with all my heart
  4494  
  4495     Des. If you say, I hope you will not kill me
  4496  
  4497     Oth. Humh
  4498  
  4499     Des. And yet I feare you: for you're fatall then
  4500  When your eyes rowle so.
  4501  Why I should feare, I know not,
  4502  Since guiltinesse I know not: But yet I feele I feare
  4503  
  4504     Oth. Thinke on thy sinnes
  4505  
  4506     Des. They are Loues I beare to you
  4507  
  4508     Oth. I, and for that thou dy'st
  4509  
  4510     Des. That death's vnnaturall, that kils for louing.
  4511  Alas, why gnaw you so your nether-lip?
  4512  Some bloody passion shakes your very Frame:
  4513  These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope,
  4514  They do not point on me
  4515  
  4516     Oth. Peace, and be still
  4517  
  4518     Des. I will so: What's the matter?
  4519    Oth. That Handkerchiefe
  4520  Which I so lou'd, and gaue thee, thou gau'st to Cassio
  4521  
  4522     Des. No by my Life, and Soule: send for the man,
  4523  And aske him
  4524  
  4525     Oth. Sweet Soule, take heed, take heed of Periury,
  4526  Thou art on thy death-bed
  4527  
  4528     Des. I, but not yet to dye
  4529  
  4530     Oth. Presently.
  4531  Therefore confesse thee freely of thy sinne:
  4532  For to deny each Article with Oath,
  4533  Cannot remoue, nor choake the strong Conception
  4534  That I do grone withall. Thou art to dye
  4535  
  4536     Des. O Heauen haue mercy on me
  4537  
  4538     Oth. I say, Amen
  4539  
  4540     Des. And haue you mercy too. I neuer did
  4541  Offend you in my life: neuer lou'd Cassio,
  4542  But with such generall warrantie of Heauen,
  4543  As I might loue. I neuer gaue him Token
  4544  
  4545     Oth. By Heauen I saw my Handkerchiefe in's hand.
  4546  O periur'd woman, thou do'st stone my heart,
  4547  And makes me call, what I intend to do,
  4548  A Murther, which I thought a Sacrifice.
  4549  I saw the Handkerchiefe
  4550  
  4551     Des. He found it then:
  4552  I neuer gaue it him: Send, for him hither:
  4553  Let him confesse a truth
  4554  
  4555     Oth. He hath confest
  4556  
  4557     Des. What, my Lord?
  4558    Oth. That he hath vs'd thee
  4559  
  4560     Des. How? vnlawfully?
  4561    Oth. I
  4562  
  4563     Des. He will not say so
  4564  
  4565     Oth. No: his mouth is stopp'd:
  4566  Honest Iago hath 'tane order for't
  4567  
  4568     Des. Oh, my feare interprets. What is he dead?
  4569    Oth. Had all his haires bin liues, my great Reuenge
  4570  Had stomacke for them all
  4571  
  4572     Des. Alas, he is betray'd, and I vndone
  4573  
  4574     Oth. Out Strumpet: weep'st thou for him to my face?
  4575    Des. O banish me, my Lord, but kill me not
  4576  
  4577     Oth. Downe Strumpet
  4578  
  4579     Des. Kill me to morrow, let me liue to night
  4580  
  4581     Oth. Nay, if you striue
  4582  
  4583     Des. But halfe an houre
  4584  
  4585     Oth. Being done, there is no pawse
  4586  
  4587     Des. But while I say one prayer
  4588  
  4589     Oth. It is too late.
  4590  
  4591  Smothers her.
  4592  
  4593  aemilia at the doore.
  4594  
  4595  Aemil. My Lord, my Lord? What hoa?
  4596  My Lord, my Lord
  4597  
  4598     Oth. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
  4599  I that am cruell, am yet mercifull,
  4600  I would not haue thee linger in thy paine?
  4601  So, so.
  4602  Aemil. within. What hoa? my Lord, my Lord?
  4603    Oth. Who's there?
  4604  Aemil. Oh good my Lord, I would speake a word
  4605  with you
  4606  
  4607     Oth. Yes: 'Tis aemilia: by and by. Shee's dead.
  4608  'Tis like she comes to speake of Cassio's death:
  4609  The noise was high. Hah, no more moouing?
  4610  Still as the Graue. Shall she come in? Wer't good?
  4611  I thinke she stirres againe. No, what's best to do?
  4612  If she come in, shee'l sure speake to my wife:
  4613  My wife, my wife: what wife? I haue no wife.
  4614  Oh insupportable! Oh heauy houre!
  4615  Me thinkes, it should be now a huge Eclipse
  4616  Of Sunne, and Moone; and that th' affrighted Globe
  4617  Did yawne at Alteration.
  4618  Aemil. I do beseech you
  4619  That I may speake with you. Oh good my Lord
  4620  
  4621     Oth. I had forgot thee: oh come in aemilia.
  4622  Soft, by and by, let me the Curtaines draw.
  4623  Where art thou? What's the matter with thee now?
  4624  Enter aemilia.
  4625  
  4626  Aemil. Oh my good Lord, yonders foule Murthers
  4627  done
  4628  
  4629     Oth. What? now?
  4630  Aemil. But now, my Lord
  4631  
  4632     Oth. It is the very error of the Moone,
  4633  She comes more neerer Earth then she was wont,
  4634  And makes men mad.
  4635  Aemil. Cassio, my Lord, hath kill'd
  4636  A young Venetian, call'd Rodorigo
  4637  
  4638     Oth. Rodorigo kill'd? and Cassio kill'd?
  4639  Aemil. No, Cassio is not kill'd
  4640  
  4641     Oth. Not Cassio kill'd? Then Murther's out of tune,
  4642  And sweet Reuenge growes harsh
  4643  
  4644     Des. O falsely, falsely murder'd.
  4645  Aemil. Alas! what cry is that?
  4646    Oth. That? What?
  4647  Aemil. Out, and alas, that was my Ladies voice.
  4648  Helpe, helpe hoa, helpe. Oh Ladie speake againe,
  4649  Sweet Desdemona, oh sweet Mistris, speake
  4650  
  4651     Des. A guiltlesse death, I dye.
  4652  Aemil. Oh who hath done this deed?
  4653    Des. No body: I my selfe, farewell:
  4654  Commend me to my kinde Lord: oh farewell
  4655  
  4656     Oth. Why, how should she be murdred?
  4657  Aemil. Alas: who knowes?
  4658    Oth. You heare her say her selfe, it was not I.
  4659  Aemil. She said so: I must needs report the truth
  4660  
  4661     Oth. She's like a Liar gone to burning hell,
  4662  'Twas I that kill'd her.
  4663  Aemil. Oh the more Angell she, and you the blacker
  4664  Diuell
  4665  
  4666     Oth. She turn'd to folly: and she was a whore.
  4667  Aemil. Thou do'st bely her, and thou art a diuell
  4668  
  4669     Oth. She was false as water.
  4670  Aemil. Thou art rash as fire, to say
  4671  That she was false. Oh she was heauenly true
  4672  
  4673     Oth. Cassio did top her: Ask thy husband else.
  4674  O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell:
  4675  But that I did proceed vpon iust grounds
  4676  To this extremity. Thy Husband knew it all.
  4677  Aemil. My Husband?
  4678    Oth. Thy Husband.
  4679  Aemil. That she was false to Wedlocke?
  4680    Oth. I, with Cassio: had she bin true,
  4681  If Heauen would make me such another world,
  4682  Of one entyre and perfect Chrysolite,
  4683  I'ld not haue sold her for it.
  4684  Aemil. My Husband?
  4685    Oth. I, 'twas he that told me on her first,
  4686  An honest man he is, and hates the slime
  4687  That stickes on filthy deeds.
  4688  Aemil. My Husband?
  4689    Oth. What needs this itterance, Woman?
  4690  I say, thy Husband.
  4691  Aemil. Oh Mistris,
  4692  Villany hath made mockes with loue:
  4693  My Husband say she was false?
  4694    Oth. He, Woman;
  4695  I say thy Husband: Do'st vnderstand the word?
  4696  My Friend, thy Husband; honest, honest Iago.
  4697  Aemil. If he say so, may his pernicious Soule
  4698  Rot halfe a graine a day: he lyes to'th' heart,
  4699  She was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine
  4700  
  4701     Oth. Hah?
  4702  Aemil. Do thy worst:
  4703  This deede of thine is no more worthy Heauen,
  4704  Then thou was't worthy her
  4705  
  4706     Oth. Peace, you were best.
  4707  Aemil. Thou hast not halfe that powre to do me harm,
  4708  As I haue to be hurt. Oh Gull, oh dolt,
  4709  As ignorant as durt: thou hast done a deed
  4710  (I care not for thy Sword) Ile make thee known,
  4711  Though I lost twenty liues. Helpe, helpe, hoa, helpe:
  4712  The Moore hath kill'd my Mistris. Murther, murther.
  4713  Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago.
  4714  
  4715    Mon. What is the matter? How now Generall?
  4716  Aemil. Oh, are you come, Iago: you haue done well,
  4717  That men must lay their Murthers on your necke
  4718  
  4719     Gra. What is the matter?
  4720  Aemil. Disproue this Villaine, if thou bee'st a man:
  4721  He sayes, thou told'st him that his wife was false:
  4722  I know thou did'st not: thou'rt not such a Villain.
  4723  Speake, for my heart is full
  4724  
  4725     Iago. I told him what I thought,
  4726  And told no more
  4727  Then what he found himselfe was apt, and true.
  4728  Aemil. But did you euer tell him,
  4729  She was false?
  4730    Iago. I did.
  4731  Aemil. You told a Lye an odious damned Lye:
  4732  Vpon my Soule, a Lye; a wicked Lye.
  4733  Shee false with Cassio?
  4734  Did you say with Cassio?
  4735    Iago. With Cassio, Mistris?
  4736  Go too, charme your tongue
  4737  
  4738     Emil. I will not charme my Tongue;
  4739  I am bound to speake,
  4740  My Mistris heere lyes murthered in her bed
  4741  
  4742     All. Oh Heauens, forefend
  4743  
  4744     Emil. And your reports haue set the Murder on
  4745  
  4746     Othello. Nay stare not Masters,
  4747  It is true indeede
  4748  
  4749     Gra. 'Tis a strange Truth
  4750  
  4751     Mont. O monstrous Acte
  4752  
  4753     Emil. Villany, villany, villany:
  4754  I thinke vpon't, I thinke: I smel't: O Villany:
  4755  I thought so then: Ile kill my selfe for greefe.
  4756  O villany! villany!
  4757    Iago. What, are you mad?
  4758  I charge you get you home
  4759  
  4760     Emil. Good Gentlemen, let me haue leaue to speake:
  4761  'Tis proper I obey him; but not now:
  4762  Perchance Iago, I will ne're go home
  4763  
  4764     Oth. Oh, oh, oh
  4765  
  4766     Emil. Nay, lay thee downe, and roare:
  4767  For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent,
  4768  That ere did lift vp eye
  4769  
  4770     Oth. Oh she was fowle!
  4771  I scarse did know you Vnkle, there lies your Neece,
  4772  Whose breath (indeed) these hands haue newly stopp'd:
  4773  I know this acte shewes horrible and grim
  4774  
  4775     Gra. Poore Desdemon:
  4776  I am glad thy Father's dead,
  4777  Thy Match was mortall to him: and pure greefe
  4778  Shore his old thred in twaine. Did he liue now,
  4779  This sight would make him do a desperate turne:
  4780  Yea, curse his better Angell from his side,
  4781  And fall to Reprobance
  4782  
  4783     Oth. 'Tis pittifull: but yet Iago knowes
  4784  That she with Cassio, hath the Act of shame
  4785  A thousand times committed. Cassio confest it,
  4786  And she did gratifie his amorous workes
  4787  With that Recognizance and pledge of Loue
  4788  Which I first gaue her: I saw it in his hand:
  4789  It was a Handkerchiefe, an Antique Token
  4790  My Father gaue my Mother
  4791  
  4792     Emil. Oh Heauen! oh heauenly Powres!
  4793    Iago. Come, hold your peace
  4794  
  4795     Emil. 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace?
  4796  No, I will speake as liberall as the North;
  4797  Let Heauen, and Men, and Diuels, let them all,
  4798  All, all, crie shame against me, yet Ile speake
  4799  
  4800     Iago. Be wise, and get you home
  4801  
  4802     Emil. I will not
  4803  
  4804     Gra. Fye, your Sword vpon a Woman
  4805  
  4806     Emil. Oh thou dull Moore,
  4807  That Handkerchiefe thou speak'st of
  4808  I found by Fortune, and did giue my Husband:
  4809  For often, with a solemne earnestnesse,
  4810  (More then indeed belong'd to such a Trifle)
  4811  He begg'd of me, to steale't
  4812  
  4813     Iago. Villanous Whore
  4814  
  4815     Emil. She giue it Cassio? No, alas I found it,
  4816  And I did giu't my Husband
  4817  
  4818     Iago. Filth, thou lyest
  4819  
  4820     Emil. By Heauen I do not, I do not Gentlemen:
  4821  Oh murd'rous Coxcombe, what should such a Foole
  4822  Do with so good a wife?
  4823    Oth. Are there no stones in Heauen,
  4824  But what serues for the Thunder?
  4825  Precious Villaine
  4826  
  4827     Gra. The woman falles:
  4828  Sure he hath kill'd his Wife
  4829  
  4830     Emil. I, I: oh lay me by my Mistris side
  4831  
  4832     Gra. Hee's gone, but his wife's kill'd
  4833  
  4834     Mon. 'Tis a notorious Villain: take you this weapon
  4835  Which I haue recouer'd from the Moore:
  4836  Come guard the doore without, let him not passe,
  4837  But kill him rather. Ile after that same villaine,
  4838  For 'tis a damned Slaue.
  4839  Enter.
  4840  
  4841    Oth. I am not valiant neither:
  4842  But euery Punie whipster gets my Sword.
  4843  But why should Honor out-liue Honesty?
  4844  Let it go all.
  4845  Aemil. What did thy Song boad Lady?
  4846  Hearke, canst thou heare me? I will play the Swan,
  4847  And dye in Musicke: Willough, Willough, Willough.
  4848  Moore, she was chaste: She lou'd thee, cruell Moore,
  4849  So come my Soule to blisse, as I speake true:
  4850  So speaking as I thinke, alas, I dye
  4851  
  4852     Oth. I haue another weapon in this Chamber,
  4853  It was a Sword of Spaine, the Ice brookes temper:
  4854  Oh heere it is: Vnkle I must come forth
  4855  
  4856     Gra. If thou attempt it, it will cost thee deere;
  4857  Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer
  4858  
  4859     Oth. Looke in vpon me then, and speake with me,
  4860  Or naked as I am I will assault thee
  4861  
  4862     Gra. What is the matter?
  4863    Othel. Behold, I haue a weapon:
  4864  A better neuer did it selfe sustaine
  4865  Vpon a Soldiers Thigh. I haue seene the day,
  4866  That with this little Arme, and this good Sword,
  4867  I haue made my way through more impediments
  4868  Then twenty times your stop. But (oh vaine boast)
  4869  Who can controll his Fate? 'Tis not so now.
  4870  Be not affraid, though you do see me weapon'd:
  4871  Heere is my iournies end, heere is my butt
  4872  And verie Sea-marke of my vtmost Saile.
  4873  Do you go backe dismaid? 'Tis a lost feare:
  4874  Man but a Rush against Othello's brest,
  4875  And he retires. Where should Othello go?
  4876  Now: how dost thou looke now? Oh ill-Starr'd wench,
  4877  Pale as thy Smocke: when we shall meete at compt,
  4878  This looke of thine will hurle my Soule from Heauen,
  4879  And Fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my Girle?
  4880  Euen like thy Chastity. O cursed, cursed Slaue!
  4881  Whip me ye Diuels,
  4882  From the possession of this Heauenly sight:
  4883  Blow me about in windes, roast me in Sulphure,
  4884  Wash me in steepe-downe gulfes of Liquid fire.
  4885  Oh Desdemon! dead Desdemon: dead. Oh, oh!
  4886  Enter Lodouico, Cassio, Montano, and Iago, with Officers.
  4887  
  4888    Lod. Where is this rash, and most vnfortunate man?
  4889    Oth. That's he that was Othello: heere I am
  4890  
  4891     Lod. Where is that Viper?
  4892  Bring the Villaine forth
  4893  
  4894     Oth. I look down towards his feet; but that's a Fable,
  4895  If that thou bee'st a Diuell, I cannot kill thee
  4896  
  4897     Lod. Wrench his Sword from him
  4898  
  4899     Iago. I bleed Sir, but not kill'd
  4900  
  4901     Othel. I am not sorry neither, Il'd haue thee liue:
  4902  For in my sense, 'tis happinesse to die
  4903  
  4904     Lod. Oh thou Othello, that was once so good,
  4905  Falne in the practise of a cursed Slaue,
  4906  What shall be saide to thee
  4907  
  4908     Oth. Why any thing:
  4909  An honourable Murderer, if you will:
  4910  For nought I did in hate, but all in Honour
  4911  
  4912     Lod. This wretch hath part confest his Villany:
  4913  Did you and he consent in Cassio's death
  4914  
  4915     Oth. I
  4916  
  4917     Cas. Deere Generall, I neuer gaue you cause
  4918  
  4919     Oth. I do beleeue it, and I aske your pardon:
  4920  Will you, I pray, demand that demy-Diuell,
  4921  Why he hath thus ensnar'd my Soule and Body
  4922  
  4923     Iag. Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
  4924  From this time forth, I neuer will speake word
  4925  
  4926     Lod. What? not to pray?
  4927    Gra. Torments will ope your lips
  4928  
  4929     Oth. Well, thou dost best
  4930  
  4931     Lod. Sir,
  4932  You shall vnderstand what hath befalne,
  4933  (Which, as I thinke, you know not) heere is a Letter
  4934  Found in the pocket of the slaine Rodorigo,
  4935  And heere another, the one of them imports
  4936  The death of Cassio, to be vndertooke
  4937  By Rodorigo
  4938  
  4939     Oth. O Villaine!
  4940    Cassio. Most Heathenish, and most grosse
  4941  
  4942     Lod. Now, heere's another discontented paper
  4943  Found in his pocket too: and this it seemes
  4944  Rodorigo meant t'haue sent this damned villaine:
  4945  But that (belike) Iago in the interim
  4946  Came in, and satisfi'd him
  4947  
  4948     Oth. Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe;
  4949  How came you (Cassio) by that Handkerchiefe
  4950  That was my wiues?
  4951    Cassio. I found it in my Chamber:
  4952  And he himselfe confest it but euen now,
  4953  That there he dropt it for a speciall purpose,
  4954  Which wrought to his desire
  4955  
  4956     Othel. O Foole, foole, foole!
  4957    Cassio. There is besides, in Rodorigo's Letter,
  4958  How he vpbraides Iago, that he made him
  4959  Braue me vpon the Watch: whereon it came
  4960  That I was cast: and euen but now he spake
  4961  (After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him,
  4962  Iago set him on
  4963  
  4964     Lod. You must forsake this roome, and go with vs:
  4965  Your Power, and your Command is taken off,
  4966  And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this Slaue,
  4967  If there be any cunning Crueltie,
  4968  That can torment him much, and hold him long,
  4969  It shall be his. You shall close Prisoner rest,
  4970  Till that the Nature of your fault be knowne
  4971  To the Venetian State. Come, bring away
  4972  
  4973     Oth. Soft you; a word or two before you goe:
  4974  I haue done the State some seruice, and they know't:
  4975  No more of that. I pray you in your Letters,
  4976  When you shall these vnluckie deeds relate,
  4977  Speake of me, as I am. Nothing extenuate,
  4978  Nor set downe ought in malice.
  4979  Then must you speake,
  4980  Of one that lou'd not wisely, but too well:
  4981  Of one, not easily Iealious, but being wrought,
  4982  Perplexed in the extreame: Of one, whose hand
  4983  (Like the base Iudean) threw a Pearle away
  4984  Richer then all his Tribe: Of one, whose subdu'd Eyes,
  4985  Albeit vn-vsed to the melting moode,
  4986  Drops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees
  4987  Their Medicinable gumme. Set you downe this:
  4988  And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
  4989  Where a malignant, and a Turbond-Turke
  4990  Beate a Venetian, and traduc'd the State,
  4991  I tooke by th' throat the circumcised Dogge,
  4992  And smoate him, thus
  4993  
  4994     Lod. Oh bloody period
  4995  
  4996     Gra. All that is spoke, is marr'd
  4997  
  4998     Oth. I kist thee, ere I kill'd thee: No way but this,
  4999  Killing my selfe, to dye vpon a kisse.
  5000  
  5001  Dyes
  5002  
  5003    Cas. This did I feare, but thought he had no weapon:
  5004  For he was great of heart
  5005  
  5006     Lod. Oh Sparton Dogge:
  5007  More fell then Anguish, Hunger, or the Sea:
  5008  Looke on the Tragicke Loading of this bed:
  5009  This is thy worke:
  5010  The Obiect poysons Sight,
  5011  Let it be hid. Gratiano, keepe the house,
  5012  And seize vpon the Fortunes of the Moore,
  5013  For they succeede on you. To you, Lord Gouernor,
  5014  Remaines the Censure of this hellish villaine:
  5015  The Time, the Place, the Torture, oh inforce it:
  5016  My selfe will straight aboord, and to the State,
  5017  This heauie Act, with heauie heart relate.
  5018  
  5019  Exeunt.
